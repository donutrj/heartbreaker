This is a d20 system. Players make Tests and Saves by rolling a d20 to determine the outomes of uncertainty.
# Tests
Players make tests by rolling a d20 adding the relevant [[Player Characters#Attributes|attribute]] bonus. If the test is made out of combat, they can add a [[Player Characters#Skills|skill]] bonus too.

Players aim to meet or beat a target DC, which means the characters suceeds. 
# Saves
Characters make saves when something happens to them, attempting to roll over or equal to their save target. 
# Advantage
There will be moments where the odds are stacked against the character and moments where the players get their character a substantial advantage.

In those moments, roll an additional d6 for each source of advantage / disadvantage (countering each out 1:1).

Take the highest of the d6 pool and add (or subtract) it from the d20 roll.
# Criticals
Whenever a player rolls a natural 20 or a natural 1, it is considered a critical success / failure. These have some specific consequences relevant [[Rolling Dice#Combat#Critical Hits|in combat]] or with spellcasters, but generally mean things go exceptionally well or rather poorly.
# Stress Dice
In stressful situations, a character can opt to reroll Tests (not Saves), adding a stress die to the pool. Treat stress dice as a separate pool of Advantage dice, except they are d4s.

Whenever a stress die rolls a 1, the character must pass a Willpower Save, else they fail the test regardless of what the roll was.

If the Willpower Save is a success, treat the Test as normal then reduce the stress dice to zero.
This game assumes combat will play out on a hexmap, with each hex accounting a 5' space. This comes into play with flanking rules and many spells have set range, that said I'm sure you could ad-lib it.
# Combat
## Turn Order
Combat is dividing into each participant taking a turn over the course of a round. Each round is roughly six seconds long. To determine who acts in what order, the players roll for initiative.
### Initiative
To determine who goes first, each player rolls 1d20, adding their Dexterity to the roll. The npcs will have a fixed initiative value, and beating that number is considered 'winning the initiative' when that matters.

Initiative is rolled at the beginning of each combat round.
## Actions
On your turn, you can move, as per your [[Rolling Dice#Combat#Movement|movement]], and take on action. Common actions include:
+ [[Rolling Dice#Combat#Attacking|Attacking]]: Using a melee or ranged weapon in an attempt to harm the opponent.
+ [[Rolling Dice#Combat#Combat Maneuvers|Combat Maneuvers]]: This could be grappling, shoving, pocket-sand, etc.
+ [[Wizards#Spellcasting|Spellcasting]]: Several classes have spell lists, and if prepared, the caster can attempt to use them as per their rules.
+ [[Rolling Dice#Combat#Item Usage|Item Usage]]: This could include lock-picking, drinking a potion, slamming a door shut.
+ [[Rolling Dice#Combat#Sprinting|Sprinting]]: It can be wise to use your action to sprint further, moving an additional 15' in conjunction with movement
## Attacking
### Melee Weapons
When attacking with a melee weapon, you must be adjacent to your target. Both you and your opponent roll an attack, usually a strength test, but this could be a dexterity test [[Equipment#Weapons#Qualities|depending on the weapons used]].
1. Both parties roll an attack using their weapon's attribute (STR or DEX)
2. The winner rolls their weapon's damage die, adding their [[Player Characters#Rolling Attributes|attribute bonus]].
3. The loser rolls their armor to reduce the damage
4. The loser take the difference in damage, reducing their HP

In the event that the rolls are tied, both parties roll for damage and armor.
### Ranged Attacks
When attacking with a ranged weapon, the attacker rolls their attack, and the defender rolls a Reflex Save. If the attacker rolls better, they roll for damage and the defender rolls armor to reduce the damage.
#### Shooting into a Crowd
In the chaos of a melee, there is a risk of hitting an unintended target. Would there be occupuied neighboring hexes, there is a 50% chance a random neighbor needs to make a Reflex save or be hit.
### Critical Hits
In the event either party rolls a [[Rolling Dice#Criticals|critical success]], they automatically are considered the winner and roll twice as many dice for damage. If both parties crits, each does the extra damage to each other.

If a player rolls a natural 1, it means their weapon has become [[Effects and Conditions#Damaged Equipement|damaged]]. They can attempt to repair it themselves in downtime with a DC12 (16 if [[Equipment#Qualities|complex|]]) Int + Coo Test. If they fail it'll require visiting a professional.

If a damaged weapon rolls another critical failure it is permantly broken.
### Recovering Ammo
Ammo is recoverable with a 5+ on 1d6. Roll for each.
## Combat Maneuvers
Combat maneuvers are a loose category of all the other crap you can do in a fight. This includes restraining, shoving, disarming, throwing sand in the eyes of a wizard etc. By necessity, the guidelines are loose.

Depending on the action, the GM will offer a test, usually opposed by an enemy's save. Should the player character succeed they will achieve some advantage. Some examples follow:

| Maneuver                                              | Test              | Outcome                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Throwing sand on the ground into the eyes of a wizard | Dex vs Ref        | The wizard is blinded for a round and must past a warding save or lose concentration |
| Disarming a skeleton by grabbing the weapon's hilt    | Str w. dis vs Phy | The weapon is ripped from the skeleton's hand                                        |
| Tackling a kobold to the ground                       | Str w. adv vs Ref | The kolbold is pinned to the ground, unable to move or attack until they break free  |
## Item Usage
Inventory is divided into Hands, Belt, and Pack (if applicable). You can use an item from your hands or belt, but using an item in your pack requires you spending the turn taking it out, then you may use it on your next turn.
## Movement
A character can move by default 30' in a turn. The movement can be paused and resumed to take an action.
### Sprinting
A character can sprint an extra 15' as their action.
## Positioning
Being based on hexes, flanking, ganging up, and cover are all important.
### Flanking
If enemies occupy opposite hexes of a character, both gain advantage to their attacks. That character (or enemy ideally) is considered flanked
### Overrun
If enemies occupy four or more adjacent hexes, the character is considered overrun. Attacks against an overrun character have advantage.
### Cover
There are two types of cover:
+ **Soft cover** such as heavy smoke, shrubs, hanging clothes, etc. grant the character advantage on Reflex Saves.
+ **Hard cover** such as thick fences, low walls, and earthworks grant the character +2 advantage on Reflex Saves.
# Recovery
It is inevitable that characters will get injured in their adventuring, and thus recovery is key to a successful adventure. 
## Short Rest
Characters can take a short rest once per day when they have 30 minutes to catch their breath, eat some food, and sit down.

When taking a short rest, roll a hit die and recover HP equal to the result.
## Long Rest
If characters get a full night of good sleep, with food to eat, they can take a long rest. During a long rest, spend **any number** of hit dice and recover HP equal to the sum.

At the conclusion of a long rest, recover one hit die.

*This means characters require downtime. If characters spend back to back days in danger, they will run out of hit dice if they aren't careful. As the character levels up, they will have more hit dice to spend and can sustain longer periods of danger.*
