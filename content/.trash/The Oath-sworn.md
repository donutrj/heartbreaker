#class #Oathsworn
The Oath-sworn are a type of person who lives by their word. They take their beliefs and treat them as law. Over time people began that this behavior lead to strength. Through dedication and sacrifice the Oath-sworn are capable of divine magic beyond holy interjection

# Creating Your Oath

Oath-sworn are not like most classes. The tenets you live by are picked at the beginning and that decides your destiny. Creative players can use these options to write a fully scripted version of their oath but for the most part this works like mad-libs

## I Follow an Oath of    "1" and "2"
This determines the primary type of ability

## To    "3"      "4"
This will determine the paths your primary ability will take as you hone your skills each will come from what you pick as 1(3) and 2(4) linked in order from level up.

## Because of a "5" 
This will be the word(s) that determine your final ability and is made from the choices of both 1&2 together

## Leveling Up Looks like this
Level 1 Primary ability linked to 1
Level 2 Primary ability linked to 2
Level 3 Secondary Ability linked from Choice 3 Oath 1
Level 4 Secondary Ability linked from Choice 4 Oath 2
Level 5 Amalgam ability linked from Choice 1&2

## Example
#### I Follow an Oath of "Redemption" and "Glory" To "Avenge" "Myself" Because of a "Betrayal"
This would mean abilities would be determined from a table found in the book for each major choice word.
Level 1 Redemption-
Level 2 Glory-
Level Avenge/Redemption- 
Level 4 Myself/Glory- 
Level 5 Betrayal - Redemption/Glory
