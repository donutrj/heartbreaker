## Spellcasting
Through study, wizards have learned the dark arts of wrestling spells into self-made holes in their brain, called spell-slots. Each morning, they study their books, wrestling the spells from the pages into their head, ready to be cast at their need.

Wizards are their own master, and have a reputation for considering themselves the most important person in any given room.

'The wizard uses a limited pool of mana dice to fuel their spells, calling them forth into the world. As they copy more spells into their books and learn more about High Art, their powers grow.
## Safecasting
Wizards who learn enough to regularly conjure powers are not foolish students. Those who cast recklessly either die young or fall into the dark embrace of sinister powers and become warlocks.

Whenever a wizard casts a spell, they may exchange a dice dice roll for a one, reducing the power, but potentially avoiding catastrophe.
