Begin building a character by rolling 4d6 and increasing the corresponding by 1:

| Roll | Result                             |
| ---- | ---------------------------------- |
| 1    | Strength                           |
| 2    | Agility                            |

| 5    | Hit Points                         |
| 6    | Roll again & increase by 2 instead |

Then roll another 4d6, assigning as follows:

| Roll | Result                             |
| ---- | ---------------------------------- |
| 1    | Panic                              |
| 2    | Reflex                             |

| 4    | Withstand                          |
| 5    | Hit Points                         |
| 6    | Roll again & increase by 2 instead |
*Rolling sixes multiple times does not mean the result stacks*
