Casting, not to be confused with witchcraft, is the classic wizardry. Long refined spells are passed from master to student, copied in colleges and libraries, and slowly iterated upon by generations.

As time passes, wars consume kingdoms, and fads pass; much of what is learned is lost to time. Branches form, and people start new schools of magic. 

Famous wizards retain credit for their spells, while the bold young add their own names to tomorrow's spells.
