# Gaining Experience
Life as an adventurer brings many challenges and if you survive you can be certain you will change and maybe even learn a thing or two along the way.

The things you learn during the game are measured in Experience Points (XP). You receive XP after the end of each game session. Talk it through and let the whole group discuss what has happened. For each of the below questions that you can reply “yes” to, you get one XP.

- Did you participate in the game?
- Did you push a roll?
- Did you make progress toward your personal ambitions?
- Did you all make progress towards the group ambition?
- Did your personality influence your actions?
- Did you defeat one or more enemies or acquire treasure?
- Were you inspired by another player character?
- Did you panic? (fail a cool test)
- Did you overcome panic? (pass a cool test)
- Did you risk your life for another player character?
- Did you accept a dark bargain?
- Did you perform an extraordinary action of some kind? 

The GM has final word when it comes to how much XP each character should get. Write down the XP on your character sheet.
# Spending  Experience

## Attributes
Increasing an attribute depends on it's current maximum. The cost is equal to (5 * Current Max). 
## Saves
Similar to attributes, cost depends on current maximums. The cost is equal to (5 * Current Max). 
## Skills
To learn a new [[Skills|skill]], a character must have successfully made a test without using a skill. At the end of that session, the player may name and increase the skill to one at a cost of 10xp.

To improve a known skill, the character must have successfully made a test or save using it. The cost to increase a skill is an additional five per level. You cannot increase a skill beyond level three.

*Level 1 -> Level 2 = 15xp*
*Level 2 -> Level 3 = 20xp*
## Talents
As long as you have the required prerequisite talent, you can add any talent or upgrade an existing talent for ten experience. You can see the list of talents [[Talents Master List|here]] and the [[Talent Trees|talent tree here]].
