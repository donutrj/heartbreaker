A character’s inventory is split between three spaces: hands, belt, and pack. Each space uses slots to roughly denote the amount they can hold. One slot can hold roughly a dozen eggs, but is more an idea than a hard rule.

| Items   | Size                                                                                                                              |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ammo    | Ammo can be stored in bundles of six                                                                                              |
| Armor   | A number of slots equal to it's impeding, while not less than one                                                                 |
| Books   | Books take up a slot each                                                                                                         |
| Clothes | A day's clothes equals one slot, more elaborate attire will require more space                                                    |
| Coinage | Coins can be grouped into sacks of 100 per slot. Loose change and other coin sized objects can be grouped together into one slot. |
| Potions | One slot                                                                                                                          |
| Shields | Cannot be stored on belt, one slot                                                                                                |
| Weapons | Two-handed weapons take up two slots, otherwise one slot                                                                          |
## Hands
Hands are what characters actively hold. There are two slots, each for one hand. If weapons are held here, they are considered drawn, and people will be hostile.
## Belt
A character’s belt is where you’d stash your weapon, ammo, and other rapidly accessible items.
## Pack
A character’s pack is where they keep bulk items that don’t need to be accessed in the heat of the moment. A pack is no less than two slots, and is otherwise equal to a character’s current [[Characters#Attributes|strength]].
