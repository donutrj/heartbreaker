Recovering from injuries takes time. When a character spend a whole night resting, they roll for 1d6 points. The result can be spent in the ways below.Â 
- Recover all lost hit points for 1 point
- Recover a lost attribute for 1 point
- Recover a lost wound for 3 points
Points do not persist between rests. If a character takes a turn at watch, they roll 1d3 instead.
## Critical Injuries
Stabilizing a critical injury in the moment requires a successful agility test. Each SL can stabilize one injury. Tests can be made once per minute. Recovery times are listed in the critical injury table.
## Magical Afflictions
