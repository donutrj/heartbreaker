Skills are a non-exhaustive group of terms that demonstrate a character has some experience with a task. If a character attempts something and they have a relevant skill, the player rolls bonus dice equal to the level of that skill during the test.

*For Example: Johnny's character, Grump "Twin Peaks" Thunderhead, is attempting to get through a doorway. Johnny sees that he has the skill Break Open and decides to test whether he can get through it. To make the test he rolls 4d6(strength) + 1d6(skill) + 1d6(crowbar).*
## Earning Skills
Whenever a character passes a test without using a skill, they mark down what they accomplished. At the end of the session, the player can [[Experience#Skills|spend experience]] to learn a skill, relevant to today's passed tests. 

Below are a list of some potential skills a character might earn along the way.
