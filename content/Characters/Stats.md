# The Base Stats
## Attributes
[[Tests & Saves#Tests|Attributes]] are used for tests. Often combined with skills, backgrounds, stress, and gear for bonuses.
+ **Strength**: the physical might of a character. It is used to test the force of a punch, the climbing of a rope, or when drawing the bow.
+ **Agility**: the speed and dexterity of a character. It is used to run away, pick locks, shoot crossbows and blackpowder arms.
+ **Intelligence**: the intellect of a character. It is used when casting spells, spotting tracks, and navigation.
+ **Charisma**: the social charm of a character. It is used in all kinds of social settings, uncovering lies, and pleading with gods for their blessings.
## Saves
[[Tests & Saves#Saves|Saves]] are used when something happens to a character. Whether when dodging attacks, remaining functional after a night's march, or keeping their cool.
+ **Panic**: made whenever a player rolls a 1 on their stress dice. Failure typically results on a roll on the [[Tests & Saves#Panic|panic table]].
+ **Dodge**: made when dodging an attack or avoiding danger. Failure typically results in a withstand save before damage is calculated. 
+ **Warding**: made to resist magical effects. Failure means the whims of gods and wizards alike will affect you.
+ **Withstand**: made to endure hardship. These are often made to avoid harm from blows with gear bonuses from armor, or might be made without when slogging through the swamps for the forty-eighth hour.
# Backgrounds
Backgrounds are what your character was before they became an adventurer. These come into play when a character makes a test in which their past experience would convey a bonus. 

***e.g.** A character with the background wheat farmer is trying to determine if it'll rain before they reach town. That player would get a bonus for their background considering predicting the weather is important to a farmer.*
## Wounds & Hit Points
When characters take damage, they reduce their hit points (HP) by the corresponding amount. When damage is severe or their HP is reduced to zero they take a wound. [[Combat#Damage|Learn more in the combat section]]. 
# Talents
Talents are the primary way players will spend the experience their earn during the session. These are situational bonuses that dramatically impact the way the game is played. 

The trees are presented left to right, with talents further down the line available require at least one of the talents that lead to it.
