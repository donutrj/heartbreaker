Clerics are the will of their god. Humans who dedicate themselves to their god are gifted terrible powers but are required to uphold their vows.

# Pledge of Service
To become a cleric means pledging your life to furthering a god's agenda. As a representative you are charged to further the will of your god. This comes as commandments and responsibilities. In exchange the god grants you a connection to their immense powers. 
## Disapproval
Failure to uphold your responsibilities as a cleric results in Disapproval. This manifests as a -1 to your pool of mana dice until you atone for your sins. 

Choose one of the following gods to pledge your existence to:
## Moor
God of the Dead, The Ferryman, The Soulkeeper.

Moor upholds the balance between life and death. Though Moor's will, the souls of the dead reach their final resting place. There they are safe from rising again as a specter, abused by devils, or used to impart intelligence on an otherwise undead corpse.

As a servant of Moor, you are charged to provide last rights on the dead and dying, bringing their souls to Moor's attention so that he may catch them in their plummet. 

You cannot tolerate the undead or spectral. You are charged to bring them down, and put their tortured souls to rest.

You cannot allow demons and their ilk to claim souls, sign contracts, or cheat others out of eternal slumber.

# Lay on Hands

# Channel Divinity
Once per day, you may immediately gain and spend an additional two mana dice when casting a spell. This excessive pull will be noted by your god and your disapproval will increase by one.

You cannot channel divinity if your disapproval has reached a point where you would not gain any mana dice during your next rest.
