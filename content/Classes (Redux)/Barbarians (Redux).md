_______
## Battle Rage
Once per day, during a combat, a barbarian may fly into a rage.

While raging, a barbarian:
+ Takes half damage from all sources
+ Has advantage on melee attacks
+ Moves without provoking reactions
+ Rolls an additional damage die when 1 or 2 is rolled.
+ Cannot be flanked or overrun

Immediately after combat ends, the barbarian must sleep for one shift if they raged. If they cannot or choose not to, they must pass a DC16 Willpower Save or are reduced to 1 hit point.
## Brutal Speed
At the beginning of combat, a barbarian rolls 1d6. On a six, they participate in a first combat round all of their own, acting before any initiative is drawn.
