## Beastform
As a druid, your bond with nature has grown tight enough to conform to it's shapes temporarily. Each form lasts up to Druid Level hours, unless you decide to revert before, or hit 0 HP. While in beastform:
+ You can’t cast spells.
+ You communicate as the animal.
+ Your equipment morphs into your new form. 
+ You must turn back into your natural form before shapeshifting again. 
+ You use the animal’s stats and features but keep your mental stats (INT/WIS/CHA). 
+ Your wild shape has HP dependent on size, which you adopt as a separate HP pool. When it hits 0 HP, you revert to your normal form and any excess damage goes through to your normal HP pool. 
### Starting Transformations 
1. Trout
2. Goat
3. Mouse
4. Frog
5. Crab
6. Deer
7. Songbird
8. Rabbit

A Druid may transform into a number of different types of beasts equal to their level. These can be any sort of beast that the Druid encounters, not limited by the starting transformations list above. To add a new type of beast to their list of possible transformations, the Druid must capture an example of that type of animal alive, sacrifice it in a clearing of trees or stone circle in a ritual that takes six hours to complete, and finally consume the raw heart of the beast. Each time they do this, their Intelligence is permanently reduced by 1.
## Bouquets
Spells of the fae refuse to be bound by the likes of tomes and scroll. Instead they roam freely in the faeland. For a druid to contain a spell and bring it into the material plane, they must prepare a proper bouquet for the spell to occupy. 

Preparing a bouquet takes a full day with access to the surrounding landscape, as all places of nature contain enough beauty to form a bouquet.

When the druid creates a bouquet, they roll 3d4 to determine it's hospitableness. Each time the druid casts a spell, they roll a d20. Should the result be greater than the hospitableness, they reduce it by 1d6. When the bouquet is no longer hospitable, the spell rushes back to fairyland.

Fire, flood, and sword all have the power to reduce the hospitableness of a bouquet. Treat them with care.

Each bouquet takes one inventory slot.
