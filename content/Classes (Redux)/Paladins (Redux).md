## Godly Servitude
Paladins devote their existence to a higher power. Depending on the personality and whims of your master, they grant you different spells to weald.

In order to cast spells, paladins must hold their weapon aloft and speak words of prayer. This means that it is not possible for paladins to cast their spells from a position of stealth, or if they are deprived of their holy symbol.

A paladin may spend an hour in prayer in the morning to prepare a spell from their spell list. They cannot prepare the same spell multiple times. 

Paladins do not deplete mana dice when they cast. Instead, the number of dice rolled is constant between all casting, and the paladin is only limited in the number of spells they can prepare each day.

Due to the divine nature of their casting, their god is not at risk of "miscasting", and paladins do not suffer the same pitfalls as the self-educated mortal casters.

### Disapproval
Paladins are in *servitude* to their gods. Any and all godly powers are at the whim of their overlords. Gods know this, and exploit it fully. Whenever a paladin does something their god finds against their liking, the paladin gains disapproval.

Any time a paladin attempts to use their godly powers when they hold any disapproval, they roll a DC8 + disapproval Wisdom Test. Should they fail the test, the paladin must spend a full day fasting and in prayerâ€“atoning for their sins.
## Holy Aura
Paladins can spend their early morning in deep prayer, asking their god to bless their kit. The paladin can either choose to bless their armor or weapon. 

Once during the day, the paladin can take the maximum roll instead of rolling for either there armor or weapon, depending on what they chose in prayer, reducing the roll by their disapproval.
