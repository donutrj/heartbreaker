________
## Sneak Attack
The rogue is defined by their ability to hit hard from the shadows. While attacking an unaware target, add your subterfuge bonus to attack and damage rolls.
## Knacks
While anyone can pick pockets, sneak through the shadows, or climb wallsâ€”no one can do it with the finesse of the rogue. The rogue has three knack dice(d6s) that they can add to rolls for any of the following:
+ Climbing sheer surfaces
+ Finding / Disarming traps
+ Hearing noises
+ Hiding in shadows
+ Moving silently
+ Picking locks
+ Picking pockets

All knack dice can be recovered by spending a hit die while on a short or long rest.
