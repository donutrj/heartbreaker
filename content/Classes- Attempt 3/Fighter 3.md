Fighters are the muscle, the killers. These are the dangerous swordsmen, the heavy cavalry, and the ones who charge first through the breach in the wall. Do not take them as fools, though some are, they lead armies and command the battlefield.

# Abilities
## Techniques
Fighters are students of war. You know a number of techniques equal to your level. Unless specified otherwise, these techniques can only be used once per combat against intelligent enemies. 

Other famous fighters develop their own techniques and might be willing to teach you, for a price.

1. **Caizo's Stratagem:** You may forgo one of your own attacks to give it to your ally.
2. **Kreussler's Disarmament:** When you strike a target, you may forcibly disarm them. Fighters get a save against this.
3. **Marozzo's Distracting Blow:** All attacks against struck target have advantage until the start of your next turn.
4. **Evasive Footwork after the Style of Matthaus**: Dodge a single melee attack with a quick backstep.
5. **Giganti's Feint:** After a missed attack, immediately make another with advantage.
6. **de Jarnac's Goad:** Struck target has disadvantage on attacks against targets other than you until your next turn.
7. **Liancour's Flying Lunge:** You may make an attack against a target you otherwise could not reach, for reasons of footing, distance, or the presence of bodyguards.
8. **Skirmisour's Menacing Onslaught:** Target immediately makes a morale check. If they fail, they flee on their turn for at least one round. If the creature wouldn't normally be scared of you, it gets another morale check after that round.
9. **Vom Tag:** Struck target is shoved away up to 15'.
10. **The Capo Ferro:** When a creature misses an attack against you, immediately make an attack against them.
11. **Miracolo's Sweep:** If an attack's result beats the AC of a creature adjacent to struck target, hit them for normal damage.
12. **Trip de Joie:** Struck target saves or falls prone.
## Battlehardened
In melee combat, you win ties.
## Mentorship
Through regular practice you are able to teach one of your allies one of your techniques. This requires regular practice and they'll never fully grasp it. 
## Practiced Killer
You've become familiar with the patterns of your opponents; and know how to best counter their feeble efforts.

You deal a critical hit on a nineteen and twenty.
### Expert Killer
You deal a critical on a eighteen as well.
## Weapon Mastery
When attacking with a weapon you have a skill of three or more in, deal an extra d6 damage.
# Subclasses
## Battlemaster
The battlemaster looks beyond their immediate struggle to assess the broader state of the fight. On their turn as a free action, the battlemaster can yell an order to their allies.
### Level 3 - Orders
Make a DC12 Charisma Test. If successful, the order is executed.
+ **Kill That One!** Point at a target within line-of-sight. The first ally to strike the target deals a [[Mechanics#Combat#Critical Hits|critical hit]].
+ **Fell the Beast!** Point at a target larger than a human (such as horse & rider or a troll). Allies gain +1 to hit until your next turn.
+ **Witchcraft! Brace Yourselves!** Allies within earshot gain advantage on magical effects until your next turn.
+ **Stand Up Straight!** Make eye contact with an ally. They remove an exhausted condition on one of their attributes until end of their next turn.
### Level 6 - Survivor
You didn't get to where you are by throwing caution to the wind, and the leadership you provide is testament.

Learn the following orders:
+ **Watch the Flanks!** Enemies cannot benefit from the overrun condition until the start of your next turn
+ **Get Back!** Point at an ally within line of sight. They can immediately retreat 10' without prompting reactions. 
+ **Get Behind Me!** Damage that adjacent allies would suffer can use your armor dice instead of their's until the end of your next turn.
### Level 9 - Opportunist
A great commander is one that finds every opportunity, and extracts the most possible. To only strike when the opportunity is clear is to be predictable, and exploitable.

Learn the following orders:
+ **NOW! NOW NOW!** Allies within earshot gain advantage on attacks on their turn, and disadvantage when not. Lasts until your next turn.
+ **CHARGE!** Until your next turn, allies that take the [[Mechanics#Combat#Actions|Charge]] action can move an extra 10'
+ **Strike, Before They Can Gather Themselves!** Attacks against surprised and prone targets gain advantage until your next turn. 
## Duelist
Competitive dueling often pairs long and short steel together, fighting against like. While not typically seen in combat, there's technically no one stopping you.
### Level 3 - Double Trouble
When fighting with two short weapons, you may attack the same target with each. Roll the second attack with a d12 instead of a d20.
### Level 6 - Patience is the Chief of Virtues
Every time you miss an attack against a target, gain an additional advantage on your next strike. This builds until you change your target or hit.
### Level 9 - Solo Artist
The duelist is trained to fight mono-e-mono. When adjacent to only one enemy, gain [[Mechanics#Advantage|advantage]] on attack rolls.
