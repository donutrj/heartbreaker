# Abilities
## Backstab
The rogue is defined by their ability to hit a target hard from the shadows. When attacking a target while hidden, flanking, or with advantage; deal extra damage as indicated in the class table above.
### Cunning Strike
When you successfully backstab, you may exchange 1d6 damage for one of the following effects.
+ **Daze:** The target must succeed on a DC12 Constitution Test or become [[Effects and Conditions#Slowed|slowed]].
+ **Withdraw:** Immediately after the attack, you move up to half your Dash without provoking Opportunity Attacks.
+ **Inspire:** Regain a spent knack die.
+ **Topple:** The target makes an Evade Test against your attack roll or is knocked [[Effects and Conditions#Prone|prone]].
### Brilliant Strike
You may now do multiple cunning strikes per attack, still costing 1d6 per effect.
## Knacks
While anyone can pick pockets, sneak through the shadows, or climb wallsâ€”no one can do it with the finesse of the rogue. The rogue has a number of knack dice (d6s) which they can add to relevant non-combat rolls, taking the best result of the dice rolled (similar to advantage).

Up to two knack dice can be used per test. Consult the class table to see your total, which changes based on level.

When you first unlock knacks, choose four of the following knacks:
+ Climbing sheer surfaces
+ Finding / Disarming traps
+ Hearing noises
+ Hiding in shadows
+ Moving silently
+ Picking locks
+ Picking pockets
### It Rubs Off Sometimes
You can spend knack dice when your allies attempt such actions, costing 2 for 1. *Two dice for every 1d6 bonus to ally actions*
## Jack of All Trades
With the varied and dangerous situations rogues find themselves in, they need to be ready for everything.

When rolling skill tests, the rogue cannot roll lower than a eight, unless it is a critical failure.
## Catlike Reflexes
Take two turns in the first round of combat.
# Subclasses
## Arcane Trickster
 It isn't uncommon for a failed student of magic to turn to theft. Whether expelled for incompetence, exiled for the darkness in their souls, or left to pick up the pieces after the destruction of their school, these students (sometimes called "tricksters", "mousers" or "scunners") can be simply too spell-mazed to return to normal life.
### Level 3 - Good Trick
Your training lets you cast from scrolls as a wizard of equivalent level, and you know one random spell from any wizard school of your choice which you cast with an MD that is always lost. Additionally, you may project an invisible mage-hand 30' away, which is strong enough to slowly move tiny objects (coins, gems, cards, keys), though it does not have enough motive force to deal damage. 
### Level 6 - Sneak Enchantment
When you bespell someone from hiding, they have disadvantage on any saves.
### Level 9 - Thief of Fire
With a bottle and the use of your mage-hand, you may pickmind a spell and an MD from an unsuspecting caster and store it for your own use. You can try to do this when someone casts a spell on you in combat if you pass a (DC10 + caster level) Sleight of Hand test.
## Assassin
Assassins are the brutal killers. They operate with efficiency and aim to make each engagement short and bitter. Likely the worst work-for-hire to short on payment.
### Level 3 - Quick Win
At level three the assassin knows their best shot is getting the fighting over with before the muscle-heads think to draw their swords.

Gain advantage on attacks against targets who's turns are after yours.
### Level 6 - Mr. Thus-And-Such
With a week and a purse of silver to the right friends, you can create a foolproof false identity.

For example, you might acquire appropriate clothing, letters of introduction, and official-looking certification to establish yourself as a member of a trading house from a remote city so you can insinuate yourself into the company of other wealthy merchants. The effect is convincing; (12+CHA vs Scrutiny) NPCs will genuinely believe your false identity unless their have information to the contrary.
### Level 9 - Let Me In
Spend three hours studying someone, their voice, their mannerisms, their stride, their handwriting etc. Thereafter you can unerringly mimic those things. You can retain a number of personalities up to your wisdom modifier (minimum 1).
## Mastermind
Rogues often turned to practical ends; stealth, skullduggery, murder, crime. But it is easily applied to the more abstracted fields of diplomacy and politics. Masterminds (who strive to one day be called "viziers") excel at these more subtle applications, and so rise high.
### Level 3 - Voice of Reason
Your soothing voice can fake any accent or verbal mannerism, and always sounds local and trustworthy. With shouted advice, you can give advantage on a test to a friend within 30' when they are attacking an enemy you can see or attempting to use a skill you have at least one level in.
### Level 6 - Game Instinct
With a full minute of study, you can intuit if another person has a better intelligence, wisdom or charisma score than you, and can guess their HD
### Level 9 - Smooth Brain
Your brain runs on several virtual levels; schemes within schemes, wheels within wheels. Your thoughts cannot be read, and if you know someone is trying you can put up fake thoughts for the mindreader to think he's reading. Magical truth detection always pings you as truthful.
