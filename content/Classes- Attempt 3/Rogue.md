# Abilities
## Knacks
While anyone can pick pockets, sneak through the shadows, or climb wallsâ€”no one can do it with the finesse of the rogue. The rogue has a number of knack dice (d6s) which they can add to relevant rolls taking the best result of the dice rolled (similar to advantage).

Up to two knack die can be used per Test. You start with 2 knack dice. Knack dice are recovered on a long rest. 

When you first unlock knacks, choose three of the following knacks:
