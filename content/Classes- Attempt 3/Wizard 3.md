# Abilities
## Spellcasting
The major feature of wizards is their ability to take dusty tomes, read them, then alter reality at their whim. As wizards gain levels, they gain an increasing number of spell slots and mana dice (see table above).

Spell slots are physical holes in the wizard's brain where spells live. When a wizard wakes from a long rest, they can spend 30 minutes to consult their tomes and choose which spells will occupy their head for the rest of the day, banishing the rest into their tomes.

Mana dice are the fish food for these magical entities. Whenever a caster releases a spell, they commit a number of ~~fish~~ dice it it's casting. This impacts the effect of the spell as described.

A wizard may cast the same spell from one of their holes multiple times in a day, assuming they have at least one die to commit to it.

When you first learn how to cast spells, roll for three random spells on the general spells list and add corresponding grimoires to your inventory.
### Mechanics
To cast a spell, the wizard rolls a number of mana dice and consults their spell.

If the dice come up as doubles, consult the mishap table. If triples, consult the catastrophes instead.
### Concentration
Some spells require concentration, which means it ends when the target moves out of sight, range, or when the wizard becomes distracted (such as when hit with a stick).

In combat, a concentrating wizard rolls with disadvantage when fighting in melee. If struck, they must pass a (10 + MD) constitution test or the spell fizzles.
### Spell Scrolls & Grimoires
When a wizard has too many spells that can be stored in their brains, they place the excess spells in scrolls. Scrolls are the ammo boxes, wizard brains are the guns.

Scrolls are functional identically to spellbooks, except they are single use, destroyed in their casting. Spellbooks are also protected by waterproof bags and metal covers, while scrolls can be damaged beyond usability. (Whenever you take fire or acid damage, each scroll you are carrying has a 50% chance of being destroyed.)

Due to the nature of scrolls, they have a mana die imbued in them. A wizard can commit more of their mana to the casting, but do not have to.
### Learning New Spells
Spells are identified by the school they are a part of. Some spells are general, which can be learned by anyone, while others a specific to a wizard's school (chosen at level three). Spells can be learned through various methods, as outlined in [[Progression#Learning Magic|Learning Magic]].
## Arcane Recovery
A wizard knows when to cut their losses. In times when the mana isn't flowing, you know how to recycle the leftover mana that still floats in the air.

When rolling mana dice, the wizard regains all mana dice that roll a one.
### Level 7 - Improved Arcane Recovery
Recover all mana dice that roll a one or a two.
## Scrollcraft
You've become familiar enough with the arcane sigils of power that you can create your own scrolls. With a day's work and sixty silver worth of supplies you can create a spell scroll from one of your grimoires.
## Vancian Magic
You've massaged the holes in your brain to the point where spells can enjoy occupying your head. Mark one of your spell slots with a 'v'. Spells cast from that slot do not mishap when rolling doubles, and only mishap when rolling triples.
### Level 8 - Improved Vancian Magic
Mark a second slot with a 'v', granting it the same benefits.
# Magical Order
When you choose to dedicate yourself to a magical order, you immediately learn three spells at random from their list. 
## Abjuration
Masters of protection and defense, abjurers create magical shields, barriers, and safeguards to ward off threats. Their magic can banish harmful spells and protect allies from harm, making them stalwart defenders.
## Conjuration
Conjurers summon creatures, objects, and energies from other places, bending reality to bring forth aid or create new opportunities. Whether pulling creatures from another plane or teleporting across the world, conjuration reshapes the battlefield.
## Divination
Diviners tap into the unseen, offering glimpses of the future, hidden truths, and distant knowledge. Their magic guides decisions, reveals secrets, and uncovers paths through the fog of uncertainty.
## Enchantment
Enchanters weave magic into the hearts and minds of others, charming, influencing, or controlling their will. With a word or touch, they can sway emotions, bend thoughts, and turn enemies into allies.
## Evocation
Evokers channel raw elemental power into explosive forces, shaping fire, lightning, and energy to wreak havoc on their foes. Their magic is the embodiment of destruction, from searing flames to devastating blasts.
## Illusion
Illusionists twist perception and reality, creating fantastical visions and sounds that deceive the senses. Their magic makes enemies doubt whatâ€™s real, whether hiding in plain sight or casting entire false landscapes.
## Necromancy
Necromancers manipulate life and death, raising the dead to serve their will or draining the vitality of the living. They command the power of decay and darkness, often walking the fine line between life and the grave.
## Transmutation
Transmuters transform matter, altering the very essence of things. Whether turning stone to gold, reshaping forms, or enhancing strength, their magic bends the laws of nature, offering limitless possibilities for change.
