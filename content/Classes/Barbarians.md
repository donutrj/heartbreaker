Barbarians fuel themselves with an inner strength, taking great risks for maximum effect when it matters. They are a martial class that take a beating and dish it right back out

# Proficencies
Unless otherwise mentioned you may wear light armor only, may use shields, and are proficient with martial melee weapons. You can still use non-martial ranged weapons.

# Rage
All barbarians have a pool of rage points, 2 at first level and +1 every level after that. You may spend a point when rolling a strength-related check to take a nat 20, or when combat initiates to enter a rage for the duration. While raging, you take half damage from all weapons and must attack each round if able (if your only option is to attack an ally, you may save to end the rage early).

When you eat a big meal, drink deep and get a good night's rest, regain a point. When you go hungry, stay up all night and brood on your many enemies, regain a point. If disrespected while your rage pool is full, save vs. flying right off the handle.
# Eye of the Storm
Barbarians revel in the chaos of battle. They cannot be [[Combat#Flanking|flanked]], nor [[Combat#Overrun|overrun]].
# Barbarian Paths
## Ancestral Guardians
For you, rage is a family heirloom passed down through generations, like a pocket-watch or a cake recipe. Its embrace is as comfortable as a pair of well-worn boots. When you scream your battle cry, a hundred ghostly voices sing in harmony. 

You are proficent with medium armor and can use martial ranged weapons.
### Progression
2. Ancestral Protectors
3. Spirit Shield
4. Consult the Spirits
5. Vengeful Ancestors
### Ancestral Protectors
In the morning, burn a pinch of incense as you face back the way you came. Old ghosts will mutter in your ears for the rest of the day. Most of their opinions are about racial politics or horse breeding, and anyone attuned to the spirit world will notice and be slightly offended. But if you point to a city, cool sword or person older than one-hundred-years they have a (level)-in-6 chance of knowing/remembering its name and feeling like telling you.

When you enter a rage the spectral forms of your ancestors appear in an icy blast, eager to wheeze incredibly racist remarks and make fun of your horse. Their presence on the battlefield is a hindrance to your enemies as well; the last person you hit has disadvantage on any attack (and deals half-damage even if they connect) against anyone besides you.
### Spirit Shield
The press of the ghostly bodies makes it hard for others to do any fighting. While raging, choose an attack or other source of damage once per round. 1d6 points of its damage are blocked. If this reduces it to 0 or less then loud ghostly voices laugh mockingly.
### Consult the Spirits
Now you're big and mean enough to demand straight answers from the clamoring ghosts. You may ask for an augury from your ancestors (the DM will tell you if a plan is well or ill depending on its 30-minute consequence window), or ask them one specific question about a person, place or thing one could plausibly have encountered. It costs a point of Rage each time you do this past the first each day.
### Vengeful Ancestors
You may spend a point of Rage to grant an ancestor a corporeal form, which resembles their body in life but has your statline (the ancestor will complain). They are a 4th level barbarian of some sort, under no particular obligation to do as you say (though they like you and are always eager for a fight), and disappear in a wisp of smoke after upon reaching 0HP or being splashed with holy water.
## Totem Warriors
For you, rage is a connection to the natural world. Merely the first step on a spiritual journey of a thousand conceptual miles. Let the monks in their cells shiver and quake and pray silently; for the fire of Heaven is on the dusty ways, and the wayside blossoms open to the blaze.
### Progression
2. First Totem
3. Second Totem
4. Communion
5. Third Totem
### First Totem
When you start down this path, you choose a totem spirit and gain its feature. You must make or acquire a physical totem object—an amulet or similar adornment—that incorporates fur or feathers, claws, teeth, or bones of the totem animal. You may also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent of your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick-skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright yellow. This is highly religiously significant, probably.
+ **Mole Totem:** No penalty when fighting blind. Walk through walls while raging.
+ **Owl Totem:** Spot movement at any distance, regardless of light conditions. Totally silent while raging.
+ **Porcupine Totem:** NPCs feel inexplicably inclined to be quiet and respectful in your presence. Everyone within 10' takes 1d8 damage from a spray of shrapnel when you enter rage.
+ **Snake Totem:** Immune to poison, identify poison by taste. All melee attacks get +2 to hit while raging.
+ **Squid Totem:** Your blood comes out in a thick, sticky black fog that conceals a 10' sphere for several minutes. Extra pair of arms per level while raging.
### Second Totem
Choose another totem animal, and create another physical totem object. The animal doesn't need to be the same one you picked for your First Totem.
+ **Mole:** 30' of tremorsense (see through walls)
+ **Owl:** Head can rotate full circle, can't be surprised
+ **Porcupine:** Roll into a ball and reduce all incoming damage to a maximum of 1d6. You cannot act, but if you roll into somebody they take 1d6 damage.
+ **Snake:** Those who meet your gaze may not break it on their own.
+ **Squid:** Once per day, throw yourself 100' in a blind panic.
### Communion
You know a ten-minute ritual which causes one of your totems to appear before you as a effulgent spirit animal and offer you guidance. It tells you about the following things as they relate to the landscape around you for about three miles as the crow flies:
+ shape of terrain and bodies of water
+ prevalent plants, minerals, animals, or peoples
+ presence of powerful celestials, fey, fiends, elementals, or undead
+ influence from other planes of existence
+ position of major buildings or collections of buildings
### Third Totem
Choose your last totem animal, and create another physical totem object. The animal doesn't need to be the same as your First or Second Totem. For most Totem Warriors, this is the last connection of this sort you will make with the world. Only a few particularly ancient and wise shamans could tell you the secret of bearing more than three totems.
+ **Mole:** While raging, your nails grow into six-foot claw-swords (d10), but you can't hold anything.
+ **Owl:** While raging, you can glide down silently from any height.
+ **Porcupine:** While raging, huge spikes grow from your skin. They can be chucked as light javelins(d6).
+ **Snake:** While raging, burst out of your skin at any point and leave it behind. You lose your equipment when you do this. You can pass through the bars of a cell if you can stick your hand between them, jump out of your own mouth to escape a guillotine, or do this a few times in quick succession to confuse the Hell out of a stupid opponent.
+ **Squid:** While raging, you can grapple with one limb. Automatically deal weapon damage to grappled enemies every turn.
## Zealot
For you, rage is a gift from your deity. Your connection to this primal force, facilitated by your god, allows you to work His ends in the material world. Other clerics, those who are not Zealots, are almost definitionally corrupt, and misuse divine power to make themselves fat and wealthy. Other Zealots, those who are not you, are probably insane, and they should be put down like dogs. Only you can be trusted to avenge the good against the world.
### Progression
2. Ablution & Dog of Heaven
3. Divine Protection
4. Neumos
5. Beyond Death
### Ablution
At dawn, noon and dusk, wash your hands and feet in potable water. If you miss one of these ritual washings you are unclean, and cannot again be clean until you have completely immersed yourself in "live" water (a spring or a river). While you are clean your touch burns immaterial undead, you may add your (level) to the damage and to-hit of any attack, and your fingernails glow in the presence of evil.
### Dog of Heaven
It is impossible to kill you before your god allows it. If reduced to 0HP and "death", magical healing works on you as if you were alive. You might need to be sewn back together if sliced into proper collops, and if you've been burnt to ash or crushed to a paste your body might need mending, but you're still not dead until your god calls you home. Allegations that certain temples have whole rooms full of the canopic remains of dozens of Zealots, "just in case", may or may not be true. No promises about what happens when someone casts a Banishment spell on you.
### Divine Protection
Once per rage you may reroll any save. If you don't like the new result, you can spend another point of Rage and reroll it again.
### Neumos
While raging you may chant a religious hymn. Any who hear you and chant along with you may add your (level) to the damage and to-hit of their attacks. Yes; if your enemies join in the chant they can add your bonus to their attacks against you. Your god isn't picky.
### Beyond Death
While raging, you cannot drop below 1HP. Roll injuries as normal.
