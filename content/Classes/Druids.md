Druids are the human representatives of nature in the face of civilization. They draw from the strength of the wild and the fae court to fuel their workings and further the cause of the fae.

Druids hail from different domains, representives of a different set of the many voices in the wild.

## Foster
With a gentle touch and a round of focus, you can accelerate natural cycles, causing trees to grow 1d6 feet, bees to construct a new hive, a spearhead to dull, and the like. However, this unbalances the affected cycle, causing the entity to shrivel or disintegrate over the course of the next hour unless you tend to it for that time.
## Wildspeak
Druids as representatives of the wild must commune with those they represent. When a druid speaks in wildspeak (a 'common' or sorts for animals and plants) they may commune with animal and plant.

Most animals are willing to talk, though plants have little to say, requiring a successful DC12 Charisma Test to coax a few words.

Teaching wildspeak to non-druids is punishable by death.
## Deputize
You can enlist a member of the Animal Kingdom as a temporary deputy.

The conditions and compensation of the enlistment must be written down and submitted to Fae Court, pending approval of course.

Most animals will be willing to work for an extended period of time if their needs are met. Their compensation could vary from food to gold to a good scratching behind the ears.
## Survivalist
Choose one of the following:
### Forager
You can gather d4+2 worth of rations by foraging in the wild. Foraging takes 6 hours. Additionally you can tell when food and water is safe to consume.
### Scavenger
You can forge items from natural materials. 2 slots worth of materials is enough to make two light weapons, one medium weapon, a longbow and 20 arrows, or a wooden shield.
### Sleeper
You can rest anywhere, under any conditions, and no longer require a campsite, fire etc.
## Beastform
As a druid, your bond with nature has grown tight enough to conform to it's shapes temporarily.
While in beastform:
+ You can’t cast spells.
+ You communicate as the animal.
+ Your equipment morphs into your new form. 
+ You must turn back into your natural form before shapeshifting again. 
+ You use the animal’s stats and features but keep your mental stats (INT/WIS/CHA). 
+ Your wild shape has HP dependent on size, which you adopt as a separate HP pool. When it hits 0 HP, you revert to your normal form and any excess damage goes through to your normal HP pool. 
+ Each form lasts up to Druid Level hours, unless you decide to revert before, or hit 0 HP.

As a general rule of thumb, the larger the creature, the more mana dice required to transform.

| Animal | Attack | Damage | Dodge | HP  | Cost |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ----- | --- | ---- |
| Mouse  | +2     | 1      | 16    | 4   | 1    |
| Eagle  | +0     | 1d6    | 14    | 6   | 2    |
| Horse  | +2     | 1d10   | 12    | 12  | 2    |

# Druidic Circles
Unlike the wizard who fits spells into holes in their brain, or the priest who acts as a conduit for the god, the druid builds homes in the form of bouquets for their spells, welcoming enough for them to willingly leave the fae and persist on the material plane.

The circle of fae they pledge to determines the pool of spells they can pull from. 
## Bouquets
Spells of the fae refuse to be bound by the likes of tomes and scroll. Instead they roam freely in the faeland. For a druid to contain a spell and bring it into the material plane, they must prepare a proper bouquet for the spell to occupy. 

Preparing a bouquet takes a full day with access to the surrounding landscape, as all places of nature contain enough beauty to form a bouquet.

When the druid creates a bouquet, they roll 3d4 to determine it's hospitableness. Each time the druid casts a spell, they roll a d20. Should the result be greater than the hospitableness, they reduce it by 1d6. When the bouquet is no longer hospitable, the spell rushes back to fairyland.

Fire, flood, and sword all have the power to reduce the hospitableness of a bouquet. Treat them with care.

Each bouquet takes one inventory slot.
## Mechanics
To cast a spell, the druid rolls a number of mana dice along with a d20 as per [[Druids#Bouquets|bouquets]].

Use the sum and count of dice to determine the spell effect as per their rules.

If the dice come up as doubles, consult the druid's circle for the corresponding mishap. If triples, consult the catastrophes instead.
