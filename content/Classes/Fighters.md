#class #fighter
Fighters are the muscle, the killers. These are the dangerous swordsmans, the heavy cavalry, and the ones who charge first through the breach in the wall. Do not take them as fools, though some are, they lead armies and command the battlefield.

# Proficencies
Fighters can use all armors and weapons.
# Starting Equipment
If this is your character's first level, your character starts with the following:
# Level Progression
1. In the Zone & Subclass
2. Subclass Feature
3. Fighting Styles
4. Subclass Feature
5. Second Attack
## In the Zone
The fighter is at home in the thick of it. The fighter gains an [[Rolling Dice#Advantage|advantage]] to all attacks.
## Second Attack
When the fighter attacks, they may perform a second attack against the same target.
## Fighting Styles
The professional fighter, much like an academic, studies a particular school of combat. Each style has it’s own origins, followings, and patterns.

These techniques are broken down in the following categories, each having a time and a place.

- **Stances**: are the way you hold yourself in combat. They are your posture and movement. Stances provide passive advantages in combat and the duelist may enter a new stance at the end of each of their turns as a free action.
- **Techniques**: are active moves in combat. While sometimes declared as part of an attack, many can be used at any time. One technique may be used per combat round.

Some styles have prerequisites as denoted in their individual sections.
### Universal

All fighters have access to a few common techniques, these are available no matter which subclass you're a part of.

- **Technique: Shield -** Hiding behind your shield, you let it take the blow. Roll your armor die twice, taking the better.
- **Technique: Parry -** When your opponent attacks, you stand tall and attempt to move your opponent’s weapon off-line. Roll 1d6, on a six the attack misses regardless of their roll.
# Subclasses
## Battlemaster
The battlemaster assumes the leadership position when things get tight. Naturally looking to the bigger picture, they lead by example, give orders, and execute on a plan.
### Orders
The battlemaster looks beyond their immediate struggle to assess the broader state of the fight. On their turn as a free action, the battlemaster can yell an order to their allies.

Make a DC12 Charisma Test. If successful, the order is executed.

You know a number of orders equal to your level in Fighter.

+ **Kill That One!** Point at a target within line-of-sight. The first ally to strike the target deals a [[Combat#Critical Hits|critical hit]].
+ **CHARGE!** Until your next turn, allies that take the [[Combat#Actions|Charge]] action can move an extra 10'
+ **Get Back!** Point at an ally within line of sight. They can immediately retreat 10' without prompting reactions.
+ **Fell the Beast!** Point at a target larger than a human (such as horse & rider or a troll). Allies gain +1 to hit until your next turn.
+ **Magicians, Brace Yourselves!** Allies within earshot gain advantage on Warding Saves until your next turn.
+ **Hold Yourself Together!** Make eye contact with an ally. They reduce their stress to zero.
### Battlemaster Fighting Styles
### One Step Ahead
Whenever the sum of your attack roll is equal to or greater than 20, perform a free [[Combat#Combat Maneuvers|combat maneuver]].






## Duelist
### Solo Artist
The duelist is trained to fight mono-e-mono. When adjacent to only one enemy, they gain advantage on their attack rolls.
### Duelist Fighting Styles

### Dual-Wielding
Competitive dueling often pairs long and short steel together, fighting against like. While not typically seen in combat, there's technically no one stopping you.

When fighting with two short weapons, you may attack the same target with each. Roll the second attack with a d12 instead of a d20.

This can be combined with [[Fighters#Second Attack|Second Attack]] to make four attacks against one target.
## Man-at-Arms
The man-at-arms is the professional soldier. They spend their life selling their sword, whether it be to nobles, companies, or bankers. This is how they live.
### Superior Training
You have trained extensively with your favorite tools of war. Pick one of the following bonus to reflex your preferance:
+ [[Equipment#Qualities|Martial]] weapons deal an extra 2 damage with each hit.
+ [[Equipment#Qualities|Light]] weapons don't reduce the damage die.
+ [[Equipment#Qualities|Long]] weapons can be used indoors.
+ [[Equipment#Qualities|Reach]] weapons don't impose disadvantage to hit.
+ [[Equipment#Qualities|Ranged]] weapons gain +2 to hit rolls.
+ When fighting barehanded deal an extra d4 damage.
### Man-at-Arms Fighting Styles
### Iron Giant
You've spent most of your walking life clad in one armor or another. Such time has taught you how to best overcome their limitations. 

Treat [[Equipment#Armor|armor's disadvantages]] as one step lower than described. e.g. light armor has no downsides, medium has light armor's and heavy armor has medium's
## Fighting Styles
### Orthodox
- **Stance: Benedict’s Third Form -** A broad, even stance that leaves options open to the duelist. When attacked, gain a +1 bonus to dodge saves.
- **Technique: Frasier’s ‘Open Counterpoint’ -** While in any of Benedict’s Forms, (barring the seventh) you may react to an opponent’s actions with an attack; using your combat action. This does not need to respect normal turn order.
- **Stance: Benedict’s Eighth Form -** A narrow, forward-leaning stance that encourages aggression. Gain +1 bonus to attacks.
- **Technique: Rynault’s Assertion, (late) -** The revised version of one of Rynault’s famous lunges. While your grandfather’s instructor likely taught the technique, that makes it no less deadly today. When attacking with a pointed weapon, the opponent only benefits from half armor as your strike between the plates.
### Fashionable
- **Technique: A Proper Introduction. -** You may direct the melee to a nearby target, bringing them into the melee whether they’d like to be in it or not.
- **Technique: Call and Response -** You may use a technique another combatant has used since you last used a technique.
- **Stance: Merchant’s Daughter -** A misleading stance. Whenever an opponent misses a melee attack, they roll a d6, and on a 1, they fall prone.
- **Stance: The Tumbler -** All unarmed attacks deal two damage instead of one.
- **Stance: The Fool -** Whenever an attack misses, you may leave yourself open to a bonus attack. If that misses as well, you may use The Fool’s Cut
- **Technique: The Fool’s Cut -** Can only be used with The Fool stance. Automatically hit a target, dealing twice your weapon’s listed damage.
### Flashy
