#class #paladin
Paladins are a martial group, who serve bound by their oath. Given power by states and gods, they pledge to uphold their oath at all costs. There are many who aspire to be paladins, but few manage to join their ranks.

# Conviction
A paladin is defined by their conviction in their oath. A paladin starts each day with conviction equal to their paladin level + 1. Conviction can be spent in a number of ways from their aura to their smite.
# Oaths
Paladins are defined by their oath. The powers that be entrust great power on paladins, both social and godly. Paladins are expected to live and die by their oaths, and should they fall short of their oaths, they are stripped of all power and authority.

Depending on the oath, the paladin will gain access to different spells. These spells can be attempted by spending a conviction point and making a wisdom test.
## Oath of Order
1. **Do not, through action or inaction, allow an innocent to come to harm.** Ignore all other tenets if they would interfere with this, your most important goal
2. In all things, obey your superiors without breaking the first tenent.
3. Do not initiate violence, except when directed by a valid authority
4. Do not touch or interact with corpses, except as necessary or when directed by an athority
5. Do not touch or carry bladed weapons except as necessary for your duties.
### Order Spells

## Oath of Truth
1. **Do not, through action or inaction, allow a guilty person to escape justice.** Ignore all other tenets if they would interfere with this, your most important goal.
2. Do not, through spoken or written word, through action or impication, lie. Go out of your way to correct.
3. Distrust all others, especially those of authority. When in doubt, assume enemy action.
4. Carry no more money, food, or equipment than you need. Any wealth you have in excess must be given to the church.
5. Ignore rules of etiquette. Be brusque and straightforward, and do not make smalltalk.

## Oath of Knowledge

2. Do not share information with the unworthy or those who would misuse it.
3. Seek out ancient tomes and ruins; do not allow information to be lost or forgotten.
4. Correct those who are under false impressions, unless this would interfere with the second tenet.
5. Accumulate libraries and stores of secret information, unless this would break the third tenet
### Knowledge Spells
# Divine Smite
Paladins exist to force their will into reality, and are ready to dispose of those who stand in their way. When a paladin strikes a foe, they can spend a number of conviction points to deal an extra d6 damage per conviction spent.
# Holy Aura
The paladin is the bulwark against the storm. Others find comfort in your presence, a certainty that it will turn out okay. Pick two of the following:
+ When conscious, allies within line-of-sight gain advantage on Warding and Willpower Saves.
+ Enemies attacking allies within arm's-reach of you gain disadvantage.
+ On touch you may spend a point of conviction to stablize the critically injured.
+ You may spend a point of conviction to make an ally reroll a save if they are in line-of-sight.
+ You may spend a point of conviction to gain 1d6 HP.
