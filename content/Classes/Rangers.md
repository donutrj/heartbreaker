6. **Interception:** You can [[parry]] as per [[man-at-arms]].

8. **Simple Sorcery:** You know how to do two of the following hedge0mage tricks with a few seconds of mumbling and finger-waggling:
	1. Light a flammable onject at a touch.
	2. Bless a fist-sized stone, that it can be thrown with the range of an arrow for 1d6 damage.
	3. Bless a club or staff, that its base damage dice bump up one size.

# Tradition

### Templates
+ **Level 2:** [[Rangers#Hunter's Prey|Hunter's Prey]]
+ **Level 3:** [[Rangers#Defensive Tactics|Defensive Tactics]]
+ **Level 4:** [[Rangers#Claw/Claw/Bite|Claw/Claw/Bite]]
+ **Level 5:** [[Rangers#Scout's Honor|Scout's Honor]]
#### Hunter's Prey
The Hunters have three traditions, which call themselves **Colossus Slayers**, the **Giant Killers**, and the **Horde Breakers**. These are the main schools of thought among **Hunters**, and every **Hunter** you will meet has a strong opinion on which is best. Choose one of the following neat tricks:
+ Your weapons seem to always seek out the bruises and cuts in the flesh, the chips and cracks in the armor. WHen you strie a target which is already below its maximum HP, your attack deal an extra 1d6 damage.
+ You are always prepared to punish the grasping fingers, talons, and tentacles of lumbering predators. Once per round, when a creature larger thana  man attacks you, you may make an immediate counterattack on its own turn.
+ Your wheeling blows and ripostes keep the swarm at bay. Once per round, when you strike a target, you may make another attack against a second target if its adjacent to the first.
#### Defensive Tactics
Your study of monster-slaying has made you more difficult to kill, gain one of the following:
+ Every wild swing from an enraged predator or whirling dervish only serves to discover their vulnerable points. For each attack a creature makes against you in combat, you gain an advantage to-hit against them specifically. This bonus resets when you land a hit. 
+ Your will is steel. You gain advantage on Physique and Willpower Saves.
+ Facing a crowd, you excel at bobbing and weaving between their attacks, causing your opponents to foul each other. For each attack made against you in a round, you gain an advantage for the rest of the round.
#### Claw/Claw/Bite
Your study of monster-slaying has given you a set of advantages to overwhelm the most dangerous targets. Choose one of the following neat tricks:
+ You can seize every opportunity for a critical hit, kind-of. When you make a weapon attack against a creature, you may choose to ignore lesser opportunities and only take the perfect shot. Roll your attack with disadvantage. If you hit, it's a [[Combat#Critical Hits|critical hit]].
+ You can shoot a whole quiver of arrows at once, poorly. Choose a circular area of radius 10' within 200'. Spend a full turn aiming a fully-loaded string of 12 arrows, then on the second turn, shoot. Roll an attack against all creatures in the area. Roll two attacks against creatures larger than a man.
+ You can fend off an army, frantically. Instead of your normal attack, you may spin in a circle and strike at all creatures within reach of your melee weapon. Roll a separate attack for each.
#### Scout's Honor 
   Your study of the traditions of monster-slaying have reached their zenith, at least among the existing traditions of Hunters. Perhaps you will develop new techniques, and pass them on to your disciples? In the meantime, choose one of the following neat tricks:  

- When a save would allow you to take half damage from some spell or explosion or the like, you instead take half damage on a failed save and no damage on a successful one.
- Once per combat round, you may choose to take half damage from an attack.
- Once per combat round, when an enemy misses you with an attack, you may force them to make an attack against some other target within their reach.
## Fey Wanderers
Were you born a changeling, or blessed by a blue fairy? Did you steal an apple from an enchanted tree, or a kiss from a fairy-prince? Whatever happened, it made you a Fey Wanderer. Your responsibility now is to the mortal and to the fey realms. As you wander, your laughter will brighten the hearts of the downtrodden, just as your martial prowess strikes terror in your foes, for great is the mirth of the fey, and dreadful is their fury.
### Skills
1. Exotic dance
2. Circus performance
3. Folk tales
### Starting Equipment
1. Two swords (any type)
2. Musical instrument (your choice)
3. Dyed and feathered coat
### Templates
+ **Level 2:** [[Rangers#Dreadful Touch|Dreadful Touch]] & [[Rangers#Glamor|Glamor]]
+ **Level 3:** [[Rangers#Beguiling Twist|Beguiling Twist]]
+ **Level 4:** [[Rangers#Fey Reinforcements|Fey Reinforcements]]
+ **Level 5:** [[Rangers#Misty Wanderer|Misty Wanderer]]
#### Dreadful Touch
Once per turn, you may infuse an attack with the misery and gloom of the farther, darker regions of Fairyland. This causes it to deal an extra 1d6 damage directly to the mind of the one struck by the attack. Such damage bypasses conventional resistances, though obviously is ineffective against mindless foes.
#### Glamor
You're very good at lying, cajoling and pretending. When you tell someone a reasonable lie (i.e. not "the sky is blurple" or "you didn't see me stab your friend just now"), they must pass a Warding Save to disbelieve you. If no one's around to snap them out of it, they'll take at least 5 minutes to reconsider your words.
#### Beguiling Twist
You have advantage against being charmed or frightened. Once per turn, when you see someone succeed on a save against such an effect, you can force another creature you can see to make a save. If they fail, they are charmed by or frightened of you for one minute.
#### Fey Reinforcements
The royal courts of the Feywild have blessed you with the assistance of fey beings. You can summon a fairy from your patron's court. This fairy is the size of a child, supernaturally lovable by dimwitted NPCs, makes two attacks a turn with its magical shortsword, and can teleport 30' instead of walking. It sticks around for one minute. The fairy is friendly to you, but is neither loyal nor cooperative, and will likely choose whichever path of action causes the most trouble rather than what would be actually helpful.
#### Misty Wanderer
With a DC12 Charisma Test, you and anyone holding your hands can step briefly into and out of Fairyland. If you succeed, you silently reappear in some visible, unoccupied space within 60' of your departure point. If you fail, you still get to where you wanted to go, but you cannot use this ability again until the next dawn and suffer some fey mischief.
## Gloom Stalkers
In the darkest places — deep under the earth, in narrow alleyways, in primeval forests, wherever the light dims — evil conspires against the world. There it labors. There it plans its cruelties. There it is least-prepared for the whirlwind you will sow. Where others fear to tread, there the Gloom Stalker is most needed.
### Skills
1. The Great Generals
2. Alcoholism
3. Extreme Sports
### Starting Equipment
1. Heavy Crossbow
2. Quiver & 12 bolts
3. Two hatchets
4. Dark non-descript clothing
### Templates
+ **Level 2:** [[Rangers#Dread Ambusher|Dread Ambusher]] & [[Rangers#Umbral Stalker|Umbral Stalker]]
+ **Level 3:** [[Rangers#Iron Mind|Iron Mind]]
+ **Level 4:** [[Rangers#Stalker's Flurry|Stalker's Flurry]]
+ **Level 5:** [[Rangers#Shadowy Dodge|Shadowy Dodge]]
#### Dread Ambusher
The best defense if a crushing assault. If you win [[Combat#Initiative|initiative]], take two turns in the first round of combat.
#### Umbral Stalker
Your enemies expect to be masters of the darkness; they are weakest when they believe they are strong. You have 30' of black-and-white darkvision. While in strong shadows, you gain two advantage to remain hidden.
#### Iron Mind
Your thoughts are full of the clashing of shield and sword. You have advantage on saves against mind-altering effects, and when rolling initiative.
#### Stalker's Flurry
Press every advantage! Once per round, after you miss an attack, immediately make another.
#### Shadowy Dodge
 The wicked think darkness is their ally, but they are interlopers in your domain. Impose disadvantage on the first attack against you every round.
## Witchhunters
Civilization tames its magicians, and makes them weak and toothless. Only on the fringes can you find the most dangerous game. Unregulated magicians, necromancers, and aspiring lytches.
### Skills
+ Arcana
+ History
+ Finance
### Starting Equipment
### Templates
+ **Level 2:** [[Rangers#Slaying Sense|Slaying Sense]] & [[Rangers#Deathmark|Deathmark]]
+ **Level 3:** [[Rangers#Superb Defense|Superb Defense]]
+ **Level 4:** [[Rangers#Magician's Nemesis|Magician's Nemesis]]
+ **Level 5:** [[Rangers#Slaying Counter|Slaying Counter]]
#### Slaying Sense
The sorcerers you hunt have all manner of magical servants, machines and enchantments, and you need to be able to work around them if you want to destroy their master. You can identify a creature's immunities, resistances and vulnerabilities with a minute of observation, unless they are sufficiently reinforced against scrying.
#### Deathmark
Once per day, you can also supernaturally mark a creature you can see. When you strike any marked creature, you deal an extra 1d6 damage. Marks reset when you sleep.
#### Superb Defense
Constant training has made you superhumanly difficult to hinder. You have +2 to all Saves, and advantage to resist being grappled.
#### Magician's Nemesis
A touch of sorcery makes you the lord of sorcerers Once per dawn, counter a spell or supernatural effect with a warcry.
#### Slaying Counter
If some damn fool makes you roll a save, immediately attack them with advantage.
