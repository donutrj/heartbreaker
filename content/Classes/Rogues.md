# Proficencies
Rogues can use light armor and non-martial weapons.
# Starting Equipment
If this is your character's first level, your character starts with the following:

climb 5' per level sheer surface



- **Technique: Cloak & Dagger -** When an opponent misses their attack, you may smoothly wipe their blade clean of any poison on your cloak and stick them with your dagger for its damage value.
- **Technique: Red-handed -** When attacking an opponent, you may attempt to strike their hand. If hit, they take 1 damage and drop their held weapon.
- **Stance: Off-Kilter -** Your posture is precarious, misleading. Opponents get -1 to the Dodge Saves when in melee with you.
- **Stance: From the Shadows -** Shooting a bow from a hidden position does not give away your position.
- **Technique: Bad Intentions -** When attacking, you may make a feint instead. For each SL on the attack, instead of damaging, gain twice that many
### Underhanded
- **Stance: The Rat -** While balanced on the balls of your feet you may make dodge saves with +1 and exit melees unopposed.
- **Technique: The Hawk -** You may make a free attack against a target who’s head is below you, and deal two bonus damage; all without giving up your position.
- **Technique: The Possum -** When struck, roll dice equal to your lost health. With 1SL you successfully fool those around you into thinking you’ve been knocked out or killed.
- **Stance: The Snake -** With hands on hips you seem unthreatening. You may attack with any weapon on your belt, drawing it smoothly and striking in a single motion before initiative is rolled.
- **Technique: The Dove -** At a moment’s notice you can quickly straighten your clothes, sheathe your weapons, and appear as though a passerby, on brief inspection.
