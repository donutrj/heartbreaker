Warlocks pledge their soul to a higher power in exchange for their gifts. Their patrons take many forms, but all see the value in exchanging temporary boons for a soul in eternaty.

# Becoming a Warlock
When you become a warlock, you promise to forever surrender pieces of your humanity to a higher power. Not any kind of higher power, but one that is greedy for souls.

When you are alone, call out to the power of your choosing and you will be answered. Each being offers different rewards in exchange for your soul. Once pledged, you cannot revoke your vows, else suffer terrible concequences.

Additional boons may be granted in exhange for your humanity or that of others. These additional boons are optional, but never revoked once promised.
# Pacts
When becoming a warlock choose a pact. With each level you can take one boon either from your pact or the [[Warlocks#Petty Boons|Petty Boons]] assuming you meet the criteria. 

You do not need to take a boon at the time of leveling up, and instead take a boon at will in a time of need. Once taken, a boon cannot be revoked.
## Pact of the Beast
Ever hungry for flesh and souls, it offers like in exchange for all you are. As you gift more to it, the servants at your command grow stronger.

When you first enter a pact with the beast, if gifts you an imp. The little thing is the size of a watermelon. It cannot speak, fly, carry more than a few coins, or move with haste.

It can however, bite(d4) and follow spoken orders.

The imp has six HP. If slain it will vanish and reappear the next morning at your side.

With each boon taken, increase the damage die for biting by one, up to d12 and increase it's HP by d6.
### Boon of Haste
Feed your imp your toes, forever hobbling you. Increase Ref Save by 2.

Your imp's legs grow long, capable of:
+ carrying a small load (2 slots)
+ jumping over gaps of 10'
+ running at the same speed as you
### Boon of Strength
Let the imp feed on your muscles, withering your form. Reduce your HP by 10.

Your imp grows to the size of a dog, capable of feats of strength. Treat it as though it was a +2 Strength character.
### Boon of Learning
Feed the imp a child.

The imp gains the ability to rapidly learn skills the warlock possesses, such as:
+ reading written texts
+ cooking and cleaning
+ spotting banners and coat-of-arms

Any such learning requires a successful DC12 Charisma test and a week's practice.
### Boon of Speech
Feed the imp your tounge, forgoing the ability to speak your own words.

Your imp can now speak, and you can communicate telepathically with it. It will also allow you to hear through it's ears.
### Boon of Sight
Feed the imp one of your eyes. Reduce your Awareness by two.

Your imp's beady eyes grow wide and humanoid. You can see through them when your eyes are closed.
### Boon of the Mouth
Feed the imp your teeth. Reduce your Charisma by 1.

Your imp's mouth grows sharp fangs. When the imp attacks, it makes an additional attack.
## Pact of the Deep Stone
Dwarves went extinct while others transcended through greed.

## Pact of the Collector
When you pledge your soul to the collector, it will ask for your deepest secret and your most treasured memory. It will keep both for itself.

The Collector gifts the warlock a ledger. The warlock is burdened to collect the signatures of fools and the desperate. They must honor any agreements made in exchange for signatures.
### Mystical Servitude
Convince a spellcaster to sign the ledger.

Learn two random spells from the caster. You may cast one per day.
### Debt of Secrets
Convince three people to willingly write their deepest secret to the ledger, letting The Collector claim the memories forever.

When negotiating, the warlock may expose a deep secret of the individual they are negotiating with to gain and advantage. This will likely ire the relationship with that individual in the long run
### Great Humbling
Convince a king or ruler to add their signature to the ledger.

### Parade of Lemmings
Convince 60 people to add their names to the ledger.

Your face becomes multitudes. It is difficult to others when they attempt to place your face should you choose. 
### False Idols
Convince a representitive of a god to sign their name into the ledger.

Appear as a holy representive of that god to mystics. Powers of that god do not affect you and gain an Advantage with Warding Saves against holy powers.

# Otherworldly Attention
When the distant powers form a link with warlocks, it grants the warlock inhuman powers.

With each level, take one of the following:
+ **Alien Reconstruction:** The warlock recovers from injury and illness faster than others. When rolling for recovery, roll an additional d6
+ **Edritch Blast**: The warlock can release their patron's raw power at a target. The warlock declares a number of d6 up to their level in warlock, rolling a ranged attack against a single target within 120' and deal (x)d6 damage. The warlock then rolls the pool of dice again and loses that much HP.
+ **Uncanny Vision**: The warlock can see in in the darkness better than they should. They gain advantage to spot things in the darkness.
+ **Frightening Presence**: The warlock knows how to strike fear into others. When attempting to indimiate an individual, the warlock gains advantage.
+ **Soul Blight**: The warlock's soul is compromised and spells hardly see them as living. They gain advantage on Warding Saves.
+ **Silver-Tongued Devil:** No deal you make could be more impactful than when you sold your soul. Gain advantage on bardering and negotiations.
