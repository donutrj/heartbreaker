# Turn Order
Combat is dividing into each participant taking a turn over the course of a round. Each round is roughly six seconds long. To determine who acts in what order, the players roll for initiative.
## Initiative
To determine who goes first, each player rolls 1d20, adding their Dexterity to the roll. The npcs will have a fixed initiative value, and beating that number is considered 'winning the initiative' when that matters.

Initiative is rolled at the beginning of **each** combat round.
# Actions
On your turn, you can move, as per your [[Mechanics#Combat#Movement|movement]], and take one action. Common actions include:
+ [[Mechanics#Combat#Attacking|Attacking]]: Using a melee or ranged weapon in an attempt to harm the opponent.
+ [[Mechanics#Combat#Combat Maneuvers|Combat Maneuvers]]: This could be grappling, shoving, pocket-sand, etc.
+ [[Wizards#Spellcasting|Spellcasting]]: Several classes have spell lists, and if prepared, the caster can attempt to use them as per their rules.
+ [[Mechanics#Combat#Item Usage|Item Usage]]: This could include lock-picking, drinking a potion, slamming a door shut.
+ [[Mechanics#Combat#Sprinting|Sprinting]]: It can be wise to use your action to sprint further, moving an additional 15' in conjunction with movement
# Attacking
## Melee Weapons
When attacking with a melee weapon, you must be adjacent to your target. Both you and your opponent roll an attack, usually a strength test, but this could be a dexterity test [[Arms & Armor#Weapons#Qualities|depending on the weapons used]].
1. Both parties roll an attack using their weapon's attribute (STR or DEX)
2. The winner rolls their weapon's damage die, adding their [[Player Characters#Rolling Attributes|attribute bonus]].
3. The loser rolls their armor to reduce the damage
4. If their armor roll is equal to or greater than the weapon's durability, it becomes [[Effects and Conditions#Damaged|damaged]]
5. The loser take the difference between the damage and the armor roll, reducing their HP

In the event that the rolls are tied, both parties roll for damage and armor.
## Ranged Attacks
When attacking with a ranged weapon, the attacker rolls their attack, and the defender rolls their evade. If the attacker rolls better, they roll for damage and the defender rolls armor to reduce the damage.
### Shooting into a Crowd
In the chaos of a melee, there is a risk of hitting an unintended target. Would there be occupied neighboring hexes, there is a 50% chance a random neighbor needs to make an evade test or be hit.
## Critical Hits
In the event either party rolls a [[Mechanics#Criticals|critical success]], they automatically are considered the winner and roll twice as many dice for damage. If both parties crits, each does the extra damage to each other.

If a player rolls a natural 1, it means their weapon has become [[Effects and Conditions#Damaged|damaged]]. They can attempt to repair it themselves in downtime with a DC12 (16 if [[Arms & Armor#Qualities|complex|]]) crafting test. If they fail it'll require visiting a professional.

If a damaged weapon rolls another critical failure it is permanently broken.
## Recovering Ammo
When sensible, ammo is recoverable with a 5+ on 1d6. Roll for each.
# Combat Maneuvers
Combat maneuvers are a loose category of all the other crap you can do in a fight. This includes restraining, shoving, disarming, throwing sand in the eyes of a wizard etc. By necessity, the guidelines are loose.

Depending on the action, the GM will offer a test, usually opposed by an enemy's skill. Should the player character succeed they will achieve some advantage. Some examples follow:

| Maneuver              | Test             | Outcome                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Disarming an opponent | weapon vs weapon | Counts as attack (risking damage). If successful, instead of damage the opponent drops the weapon. Two-handed weapons have adv on the roll. The weapon falls within 5'. |
| Knock opponent prone  | weapon vs evade  | Enemy is knocked prone on success. Disadvantage if using one-handed weapon.                                                                                             |
| Grapple               | Brawl vs Brawl   | On success both fall prone and can't move. On fail, only attacker becomes prone. Either party can retest on turn to attempt to break free.                              |
# Item Usage
Inventory is divided into Hands, Belt, and Pack (if applicable). You can use an item from your hands or belt, but using an item in your pack requires you spending the turn taking it out, then you may use it on your next turn.
# Movement
A character can move by default 30' in a turn. The movement can be paused and resumed to take an action.
## Sprinting
A character can sprint an extra 15' as their action.
## Difficult Terrain
It takes 10' worth of movement to enter a hex of difficult terrain
# Positioning
Being based on hexes, flanking, ganging up, and cover are all important.
## Flanking
If enemies occupy opposite hexes of a character, both gain advantage to their attacks. That character (or enemy ideally) is considered flanked
## Overrun
If enemies occupy four or more adjacent hexes, the character is considered overrun. Attacks against an overrun character have advantage. Characters can be both flanked and overrun.
## Cover
There are two types of cover:
+ **Soft cover** such as heavy smoke, shrubs, hanging clothes, etc. grant the character advantage on evade tests.
+ **Hard cover** such as thick fences, low walls, and earthworks grant the character +2 advantage on evade tests.
