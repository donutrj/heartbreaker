This is a d20 system. Players make Tests and Saves by rolling a d20 to determine the outcomes of uncertainty.
# Tests
Players make tests by rolling a d20 adding the relevant [[Player Characters#Attributes|attribute]] bonus and if called for, a [[Player Characters#Skills|skill]] bonus too.

Players aim to meet or beat a target DC, which means the characters succeeds. 
# Advantage
There will be moments where the odds are stacked against the character and moments where the players get their character a substantial advantage.

In those moments, roll an additional d6 for each source of advantage / disadvantage (countering each out 1:1).

Take the highest of the d6 pool and add (or subtract) it from the d20 roll.
# Criticals
Whenever a player rolls a natural 20 or a natural 1, it is considered a critical success / failure. These have some specific consequences relevant [[Mechanics#Combat#Critical Hits|in combat]] or with spellcasters, but generally mean things go exceptionally well or rather poorly.
# Pushing
Whenever you fail a Test, player characters may attempt to push the roll.

Attempt the roll a second time, with the second result being final. In the event the pushed roll was a fail, [[Effects and Conditions#Exhausted Attribute|exhaust]] either the relevant attribute or two others.

You cannot push a roll with an exhausted attribute.
