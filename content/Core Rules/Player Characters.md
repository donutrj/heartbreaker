# Classes
Classes help define the niche that your character fits within. Each class has five levels, which are progressed through as your character gains [[experience]].

Each class funtions differently, leveraging different systems to create a variety of effects. Some classes are martial, focusing on being in the front, while others focus on magic, or a combo of the two.
## Multiclassing
Players may opt to spend their experience to multiclass. When multi-classing, different classes will give different bonuses to shared features such as [[Player Characters#Saves|saves]], in such cases, take the best from the classes the character has branched into.
