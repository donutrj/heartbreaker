# Injury & Recovery
It is inevitable that characters will get injured in their adventuring, and thus recovery is key to a successful adventure. 
## Short Rest
Characters can take a short rest once per day when they have 30 minutes to catch their breath, eat some food, and sit down.

When taking a short rest, roll a hit die and recover HP equal to the result. This does not spend a hit die as long resting does.
## Long Rest
If characters get a full night of good sleep, with food to eat, they can take a long rest. During a long rest, spend **any number** of hit dice and recover HP equal to the sum.

A number of exhausted stats can be recovered equal to the number of hit dice spent on healing during the long rest.

At the conclusion of a long rest, recover one hit die.

*This means characters require downtime. If characters spend back to back days in danger, they will run out of hit dice if they aren't careful. As the character gains experience, they will have more hit dice to spend and can sustain longer periods of danger.*
## Death's Door
When a character is reduced to zero hit points, they stand on death's door. Immediately make a Death Save. (Roll a d20. 11+ is a success). Make another death save at the start of each of your turns. 

The second time in a row you fail a Death Save, you die. On the second success in a row, you are unconscious, but stable.

A successful DC12 Healing Test made by an ally counts as a successful Death Save.
