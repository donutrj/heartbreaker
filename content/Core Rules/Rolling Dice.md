This is a d20 system. Players make Tests and Saves by rolling a d20 to determine the outomes of uncertainty.
# Tests
Players make tests by rolling a d20 adding the relevant [[Player Characters#Attributes|attribute]] bonus. If the test is made out of combat, they can add a [[Player Characters#Skills|skill]] bonus too.

Players aim to meet or beat a target DC, which means the characters suceeds. 
# Saves
Characters make saves when something happens to them, attempting to roll over or equal to their save target. 
# Advantage
There will be moments where the odds are stacked against the character and moments where the players get their character a substantial advantage.

In those moments, roll an additional d6 for each source of advantage / disadvantage (countering each out 1:1).

Take the highest of the d6 pool and add (or subtract) it from the d20 roll.
# Criticals
Whenever a player rolls a natural 20 or a natural 1, it is considered a critical success / failure. These have some specific concequences relavent [[Combat#Critical Hits|in combat]] or with spellcasters, but generally mean things go exceptionally well or rather poorly.
# Stress Dice
In stressful situations, a character can opt to reroll Tests (not Saves), adding a stress die to the pool. Treat stress dice as a seperate pool of Advantage dice, except they are d4s.

Whenever a stress die rolls a 1, the character must pass a Willpower Save, else they fail the test regardless of what the roll was.

If the WIllpower Save is a sucess, treat the Test as normal then reduce the stress dice to zero.
