4. Dabbling
# Knacks
While anyone can pick pockets, sneak through the shadows, or climb walls—no one can do it with the finesse of the rogue. The rogue has a number of knack dice(d6s) equal to their level that they can add to rolls for any of the following:
+ Climbing sheer surfaces
+ Finding / Disarming traps
+ Hearing noises
+ Hiding in shadows
+ Moving silently
+ Picking locks
+ Picking pockets

Knack dice can be recovered by spending a hit die while on a short or long rest.
# Sneak Attack
The rogue is defined by their ability to hit hard from the shadows. While attacking an unaware target, add your subterfuge bonus to attack and damage rolls. 
# Lucky 
Rogues rely on luck and finesse. They receive a pool of luck points to spend on rerolling dice. Whenever a rogue is dissatisfied with a roll, after learning of the consequences, the player can spend a luck point and reroll the die, taking the new result.  

Luck points are recovered on a long rest.

| Level | Luck Points |
| ----- | ----------- |
| 3     | 1           |
| 4     | 2           |
| 5     | 3           |
# Dabbling
Rogues are always expanding their skillsets. Experienced rogues learn from their peers, adapting what works into their catalog of tricks. When you learn this feature, take one of the following.

# Starting Equipment
If this is your character's first level, your character starts with the following:























- **Technique: Cloak & Dagger -** When an opponent misses their attack, you may smoothly wipe their blade clean of any poison on your cloak and stick them with your dagger for its damage value.
- **Technique: Red-handed -** When attacking an opponent, you may attempt to strike their hand. If hit, they take 1 damage and drop their held weapon.
- **Stance: Off-Kilter -** Your posture is precarious, misleading. Opponents get -1 to the Dodge Saves when in melee with you.
- **Stance: From the Shadows -** Shooting a bow from a hidden position does not give away your position.
- **Technique: Bad Intentions -** When attacking, you may make a feint instead. For each SL on the attack, instead of damaging, gain twice that many
### Underhanded
- **Stance: The Rat -** While balanced on the balls of your feet you may make dodge saves with +1 and exit melees unopposed.
- **Technique: The Hawk -** You may make a free attack against a target who’s head is below you, and deal two bonus damage; all without giving up your position.
- **Technique: The Possum -** When struck, roll dice equal to your lost health. With 1SL you successfully fool those around you into thinking you’ve been knocked out or killed.
- **Stance: The Snake -** With hands on hips you seem unthreatening. You may attack with any weapon on your belt, drawing it smoothly and striking in a single motion before initiative is rolled.
- **Technique: The Dove -** At a moment’s notice you can quickly straighten your clothes, sheathe your weapons, and appear as though a passerby, on brief inspection.
