## Godly Servitude
Clerics devote their existence to a higher power. Depending on the personality and whims of your master, they grant you different spells to weald.

In order to cast spells, Clerics must hold their holy symbol aloft, speak words of prayer and supplication, and use their other hand to draw holy symboligy in the air. This means that it is not possible for Clerics to cast their spells from a position of stealth, or if they are deprived of their holy symbol.

A cleric may spend an hour in prayer in the morning to prepare a spell from their spell list. They cannot prepare the same spell multiple times. 

Clerics do not deplete mana dice when they cast. Instead, the number of dice rolled is constant between all casting, and the cleric is only limited in the number of spells they can prepare each day.

Due to the divine nature of their casting, their god is not at risk of "miscasting", and clerics do not suffer the same pitfalls as the self-educated mortal casters.

Whenever a cleric rolls a 6 on a mana dice, they gain one disaproval.

### Disapproval
Clerics are in *servitude* to their gods. Any and all godly powers are at the whim of their overlords. Gods know this, and exploit it fully. Whenever a Cleric does something their god finds against their liking, the cleric gains disapproval.

Any time a cleric attempts to use their godly powers when they hold any disapproval, they roll a DC8 + disapproval Wisdom Test. Should they fail the test, the cleric must spend a full day fasting and in prayerâ€“atoning for their sins.
## Blessings
Clerics are mouthpiece of their gods, responsible for spreading their will among the people. As a symbol of goodwill, gods allow their clerics to bless those in need, and curse their enemies. Depending on the cleric's god the targets will change, but they broadly fall into Lay on Hands, and Turn Unholy.
### Lay on Hands
The cleric may hold their holy symbol while resting a hand on a willing target once per day. The target regains Hit Points according to the following:

| Alignment | Recovery    |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Unaligned | 1 Hit Point |
| Neutral   | 1 Hit Die   |
| Aligned   | 2 Hit Dice  |

When a cleric heals an unaligned target, they gain 1d3 disapproval. If they heal a neutral target, they gain 1 instead.
### Turn Unholy
The cleric shouts in holy prayer, holding their symbol aloft. The cleric spends a number of mana dice recording the sum. The sum worth of HD unholy creatures are turned, forced to flee or suffer (count)d6 damage for 10 minutes.
