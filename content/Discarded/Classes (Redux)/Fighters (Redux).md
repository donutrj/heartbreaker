## Techniques
Fighters are students of war. You know a number of techniques equal to your level. Unless specified otherwise, these techniques can only be used once per combat against intelligent enemies. 

Other famous fighters develop their own techniques and might be willing to teach you, for a price.

1. **Caizo's Stratagem:** You may forgo one of your own attacks to give it to your ally.
2. **Kreussler's Disarmament:** When you strike a target, you may forcibly disarm them. Fighters get a save against this.
3. **Marozzo's Distracting Blow:** All attacks against struck target have advantage until the start of your next turn.
4. **Evasive Footwork after the Style of Matthaus**: Dodge a single melee attack with a quick backstep.
5. **Giganti's Feint:** After a missed attack, immediately make another with advantage.
6. **de Jarnac's Goad:** Struck target has disadvantage on attacks against targets other than you until your next turn.
7. **Liancour's Flying Lunge:** You may make an attack against a target you otherwise could not reach, for reasons of footing, distance, or the presence of bodyguards.
8. **Skirmisour's Menacing Onslaught:** Target immediately makes a morale check. If they fail, they flee on their turn for at least one round. If the creature wouldn't normally be scared of you, it gets another morale check after that round.
9. **Vom Tag:** Struck target is shoved away up to 15'.
10. **The Capo Ferro:** When a creature misses an attack against you, immediately make an attack against them.
11. **Miracolo's Sweep:** If an attack's result beats the AC of a creature adjacent to struck target, hit them for normal damage.
12. **Trip de Joie:** Struck target saves or falls prone.
## One Step Ahead
Whenever the sum of your attack roll is equal to or greater than 20, and deal damage, you may make another action.
