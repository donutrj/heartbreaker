## Slaying Sense
The prey you hunt have all manner of weapons, talents, and enchantments. You need to be able to work around them if you want to destroy your enemies. You can identify a creature's immunities, resistances and vulnerabilities with a minute of observation, unless they are sufficiently reinforced against scrying or seeking to mislead.

In combat, every wild swing from an enraged predator or whirling dervish only serves to discover their vulnerable points. With each miss, you you gain an advantage to-hit against them specifically. This bonus resets when you land a hit. You can focus on a number of targets equal to your intelligence modifier.
