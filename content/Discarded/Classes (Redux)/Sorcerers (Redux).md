## Spellcasting
Sorcerers have the innate ability to cast spells. Why spells took residence in the sorcerer's brain is nebulous, they were simply born with it. Unlike the wizard who spends the morning pouring through pages of tomes, the sorcer's brain is desirable and spells naturally seek out the holes in it.

Some shun the sorcerer, for they are often the lightning rod of the magical. Demons, fey, and the mundane lightning are first drawn to the sorcerer.

As with the wizard, the sorcerer casts magic with their mana dice, and learn new spells as they gain experience. Read more about casting spells here.
## Thaumic Alignment
Sorcerers are naturally gifted, and thaumic charges course through their blood with ease. Instead of losing mana dice on a five or six, they instead only lose mana dice on a rolled six.
