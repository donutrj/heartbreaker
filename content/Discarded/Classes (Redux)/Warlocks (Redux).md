## Spellcasting
Warlocks exchange their soul's fate in exchange for powers. Unlike the cleric who exchanges devotion and duty with a god, warlocks deal with the less scrupulous powers. Those on the fringe, or those too dangerous to be treated as a god.

As with the wizard, the warlock casts magic with their mana dice, learning the magic of their benefactor. Read more about casting spells here.
## Overcasting
Warlocks are known to stretch themselves to the limit, pushing their spellcraft to the limit.

Once per day, warlocks can exchange one of their rolled mana dice for a 6, maximizing the sum. The overexertion results in 1d8 damage.
