Here's my idea, steal the d10 momentum system from [Spectre Operations](https://spectreminiatures.com/blogs/news/spectre-operations-design-notes-engagements).

Nothing wants to get hit, simple as. The default to-hit number is an 8. Players get three momentum per round to spend on all actions and reactions. This could be to move, attack, block, reload, etc.

If they want a better chance to hit someone, they need to find advantage or commit more than one momentum to an attack.

Okay but how do I mesh that with the simultaneous attacks from the game so far? I like that, it speeds combat up massively.

Okay what about this; the defender can spend momentum to riposte or dodge. 
## Riposte
Whoever rolls higher gets hit. If tie, both get hit (unless fighter). Multiple 
## Dodge
Dodging the attacker to roll higher to deal damage. Depending how much momentum committed to the dodge, the effectiveness of the dodge is different.
1. Spending one momentum requires the attacker to roll an 8+ to hit (subject to armor's impeding)
2. Spending two requires the attacker to roll a 9
3. Spending three requires the attacker to roll a 10
-----
If the defender doesn't have any momentum to spend, they are forced to **take it on the armor**, rolling their armor die.

coming back a day later, I'm thinking that I prefer always the riposte option. There's no momentum cost for the riposte, but only the attacker can spend more than one to increase their odds. Also the attacker wins ties, because they're the ones spending to make stuff happen.

# Initiative
Troika initiative.
Everyone has a color bead / dice / poker chip / card etc. As do enemies.
1. Add chips for each player character equal to their **momentum**.
2. Add chips for each enemy equal to their **momentum**.
3. Add one round-end chip

Start each **round** with all chips in a bag. When a character's chip is drawn, they take a **turn**. When the round-end chip is drawn, put all chips back in the bag.

When effect chips are drawn, their effect occurs. These can include things like fire, poison, bleeding, and death throws.
