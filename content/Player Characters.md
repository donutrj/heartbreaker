Player characters are adventurers, while they might've done may things before they went on adventures, that isn't what they are doing now. Adventurers might be solo, spelunking caves and mapping the hollows or breaking into mansions and stealing treasures. They might be a part of a company, fulfilling contracts, winning elections, or fighting in an army.
# Characteristics 
Characteristics are traits rolled or picked when making a character. These have no mechanical function but are intended as aids when roleplaying to help get you into a character.
# Backgrounds
Backgrounds are what your character was before they became an adventurer. These come into play when a character makes a test in which their past experience would convey a bonus. 

***e.g.** A character with the background wheat farmer is trying to determine if it'll rain before they reach town. That player would get a bonus for their background considering predicting the weather is important to a farmer.*
# Attributes
Attributes are used for tests. Often combined with skills, backgrounds, stress, and gear for bonuses.
## Strength
Strength is the physical might of a character. It is used to test the force of a punch, the climbing of a rope, or when drawing the bow.
## Agility
Agility is the speed and dexterity of a character. It is used to run away, pick locks, shoot crossbows and blackpowder arms.
## Intelligence
Intelligence is the intellect of a character. It is used when casting spells, spotting tracks, and navigation.
## Personality
Personality is the social charm of a character. It is used in all kinds of social settings, uncovering lies, and pleading with gods for their blessings.
# Saves
Saves are used when something happens to a character. Whether when dodging attacks, remaining functional after a night's march, or keeping their cool.
## Panic
Panic saves are made whenever a player rolls a 1 on their stress dice. Failure typically results on a roll on the panic table.
## Reflex
Reflex saves are made when dodging an attack or avoiding danger. Failure typically results in a withstand save before damage is calculated. 
## Warding
Warding saves are made to resist magical effects. Failure means the whims of gods and wizards alike will effect you.
## Withstand
Withstand saves are made to endure hardship. These are often made to avoid harm from blows with gear bonuses from armor, or might be made without when slogging through the swamps for the fourth-eighth hour
# Talents
Talents are the primary way players will spend the xp their earn during the session. These are situational bonuses that dramatically impact the way the game is played. 

Talents are what might make a character a wizard or a duelist. 
# Skills
As characters push themselves they'll inevitably learn new skills. A once-farmer that spend their days breaking into the homes of the elite will likely be a better lock-pick one year in than on the first day. 

During play when a test aligns with a skill, the player will roll an extra die to represent their proficiency. Read more about learning skills here. #edit 

# Wounds & Hit Points
When characters take damage, they reduce their hit points (HP) by the corresponding amount. When damage is severe or their HP is reduced to zero they take a wound. Learn more in the combat section.
