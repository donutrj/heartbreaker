# Gaining Experience
At the end of each session, the GM will ask the following questions. For each you can say yes to, gain one experience point (XP). Record your total and current experience separately, as XP is spent for mechanical progression.
## Experience Questions
1. Did you participate in the game?
2. Did you explore a new location?
3. Did you push a roll?
4. Did you defeat one or more enemies?
5. Did you overcome a challenge without using force?
# Character Growth 
## Class Features
Each class has a tree of abilities, which cost an increasing amount as you acquire more. This is how wizards cast more dangerous spells and barbarians hit with ever greater damage. Consult the table below for costs.

| # Abilities | XP Cost |
| ----------- | ------- |
| 0-3         | 3       |
| 5-10        | 5       |
| 10+         | 7       |

When a path has branching options, solid arrows indicate a either/or option, and dashed arrows indicate non-exclusive options. Consult the [[Player Characters#Classes|class pages]] for more details. 
## Experience Thresholds
At cumulative experience milestones, all characters improve their attributes and increase the number of hit dice available to them. Consult the chart below:

| Experience | Attribute Improvement | Hit Dice |
| ---------- | --------------------- | -------- |
| 2          |                       | 2        |
| 10         |                       | 3        |
| 20         | x                     | 4        |
| 35         |                       | 5        |
| 55         |                       | 6        |
| 80         | x                     | 7        |
| 120        |                       | 8        |
| 155        |                       | 9        |
| 190        | x                     | 10       |
### Attribute Improvement
Improve one of your attributes by two or two of your attributes by one, up to a limit of 18. If you improve at least one of your core attributes as dictated by your class, gain two experience points.
### Hit Dice
Every time you increase the total number of your hit dice, increase your Hit Points by your Hit Die (d6, d8, etc.) plus your constitution modifier.
## Skills
Whenever you fail a skill test, mark it in the circle next to the skill in your character sheet. When you fill the three circles, you cannot add any more marks to the track. 

Spending three experience points, you may erase the three circles and roll 1d6. Should the result be greater than your current skill bonus, increase it by one.
### Mentors
A day of intense training with a mentor of greater skill grants you an additional die when you attempt to improve your skill. You cannot return to the same mentor to improve the same skill twice, unless you've improved it a second time without their help.
## Feats
Feats are first added to the **Training** section of the character sheet. There they can be used, costing one experience point each time. Once used three times, they are moved to **Learned**, where they can be used for free.

The cost to add a feat to **Training** costs eight experience points.
## Learning Magic
You can learn new spells from a teacher or grimoire. You must have a skill level in the relevant school of magic, or any school of magic for general spells. Schools of magic can only be learned through your class.
### Teachers
The easiest (but often most expensive) way to learn a spell is from a teacher who already knows it. The lesson takes one day and costs five experience points.
### Grimoires
If you are lucky, you can find spells in other mages' grimoires. You can learn them on your own. This works the same way as with a teacher.
