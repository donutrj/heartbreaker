# Gaining Experience
At the end of each session, the GM will ask the following questions. For each you can say yes to, gain one experience point (XP). Record your total and current experience separately, as XP is spent for mechanical progression.
## Experience Questions
1. Did you participate in the game?
2. Did you explore a new location?
3. Did you push a roll?
4. Did you defeat one or more enemies?
5. Did you overcome a challenge without using force?
# Character Growth 
## Levels
At cumulative experience milestones, all characters improve their attributes and increase the number of hit dice available to them. Consult the chart below:

| Level | Experience Required | Attribute Improvement | Hit Dice |
| ----- | ------------------- | --------------------- | -------- |
| 1     | 2                   |                       | 1        |
| 2     | 10                  |                       | 2        |
| 3     | 20                  | x                     | 3        |
| 4     | 35                  |                       | 4        |
| 5     | 55                  |                       | 5        |
| 6     | 80                  | x                     | 6        |
| 7     | 110                 |                       | 7        |
| 8     | 145                 |                       | 8        |
| 9     | 185                 | x                     | 9        |
| 10    | 230                 |                       | 10       |
### Attribute Improvement
Improve one of your attributes by two or two of your attributes by one, up to a limit of 18. If you improve at least one of your core attributes as dictated by your class, gain two experience points.
### Hit Dice
Every time you increase the total number of your hit dice, increase your Hit Points by your Hit Die (d6, d8, etc.) plus your constitution modifier.

*e.g. when a rogue reaches level 2, they roll a d8 + CON and add that to their current maximum experience.*
### Class Features
With each level, depending on your class, you'll learn new features. See more on each of the class pages!
## Skills
Whenever you fail a skill test, mark it in the circle next to the skill in your character sheet. When you fill the three circles, you cannot add any more marks to the track. 

Spending three experience points, you may erase the three circles and roll 1d6. Should the result be greater than your current skill bonus, increase it by one.
### Mentors
A day of intense training with a mentor of greater skill grants you an additional die when you attempt to improve your skill. You cannot return to the same mentor to improve the same skill twice, unless you've improved it a second time without their help.
## Feats
Feats are first bought for ten experience points. Once bought, they are added to the training section. There, they can be used, each time costing an additional experience point. Each time you use a feat in training, roll a d6. Should you roll a 5+, move the feat to the learned section. Learned feats take no experience to use.
### Mentors
In cases where a mentor teaches you one of their known feats, usually at great expense, the learning roll is eased to a 4+. 
## Learning Magic
You can learn new spells from a teacher or grimoire. You must have a skill level in the relevant school of magic, or any school of magic for general spells. Schools of magic can only be learned through your class.
### Teachers
The easiest (but often most expensive) way to learn a spell is from a teacher who already knows it. The lesson takes one day and costs five experience points.
### Grimoires
If you are lucky, you can find spells in other mages' grimoires. You can learn them on your own, but without guidance, it takes a week to decipher rather than a day. 

Grimoires are typically not shared between wizards.
