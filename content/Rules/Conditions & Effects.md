# Blindness
All tests that require a target, are attempted by first rolling a d6. On a 4+ the test can be attempted, if not, the test fails without rolling.
# Exhaustion
A -1 to all tests and saves, can stack.
# Prone
Falling prone takes an action to recover from. When attacking a prone enemy, attack with +2 bonus.
