# Styles
The professional duelist, much like an academic, studies a particular school of combat. Each style has it's own origins, followings, and patterns.

These techniques are broken down in the following categories, each having a time and a place.
+ **Stances**: are the way you hold yourself in combat. They are your posture and movement. Stances provide passive advantages in combat and the duelist may enter a new stance at the end of each of their turns as a free action.
+ **Techniques**: are active moves in combat. While sometimes declared as part of an attack, many can be used at any time. One technique may be used per combat round.

Some styles have prerequisites as denoted in their individual sections.
## Universal
All duelists have access to a few common techniques, these are available no matter which schools you learn.
+ **Technique: Shield -** Hiding behind your shield, you let it take the blow. Double the number of gear dice from your shield.
+ **Technique: Parry -** You stand tall and attempt to move your opponent's weapon off-line. Roll 1d6, on a six the attack misses.
+ **Technique: Riposte -** When an opponent misses their strike, you may deal 2 damage in a counterattack.
## Orthodox
+ **Stance: Benedict's Third Form -** A broad, even stance that leaves options open to the duelist. When attacked, gain a +1 bonus to reflex saves.
+ **Technique: Frasier's 'Open Counterpoint' -** While in any of Benedict's Forms, (barring the seventh) you may react to an opponent's actions with an attack; using your combat action. This does not need to respect normal turn order.
+ **Stance: Benedict's Eighth Form -** A narrow, forward-leaning stance that encourages aggression. Gain +1 bonus to attacks.
+ **Technique: Rynault's  Assertion, (late) -** The revised version of one of Rynault's famous lunges. While your grandfather's instructor likely taught the technique, that makes it no less deadly today. When attacking with a pointed weapon, the opponent only benefits from half armor as your strike between the plates.

## Fashionable
+ **Technique: Draw. Quarter. Cut. -**
+ **Technique: Parry. Step. Jab. -**
+ **Stance: Merchant's Daughter -**
+ **Stance: A Lord's Pride -**
+ **Stance: The Fool -**
+ **Technique: The Fool's Cut -**
## Flashy
- Technique: HI-YAH! -
- Technique: AHHH! -
- Technique: HA! -
- Technique: HOO-AH! -
- Technique: HEE-YAH! -
take it on the armor, bonus counterattack
dramatic lunge with downside
risk it for the biscuit stance
jab jab jab


## Discrete
+ **Technique: Cloak & Dagger -** When an opponent misses their attack, you may smoothly wipe their blade clean of any poison on your cloak and stick them with your dagger for it's damage value.
+ **Technique: Red-handed -** When attacking an opponent, you may attempt to strike their hand. If hit, they take 1 damage and drop their held weapon. 
+ **Stance: Off-Kilter -** Your posture is precarious, misleading. Opponents get -1 to their Reflex Saves when in melee with you.
+ **Stance: From the Shadows -** Shooting a bow from a hidden position does not give away your position.
+ **Technique: Bad Intentions -** When attacking, you may make a feint instead. For each SL on the attack, instead of damaging, gain twice that many bonus dice on the next attack made against the target, whether you or an ally makes the attack.
## Knightly
+ **Technique: Vanquish the Wicked -** When connecting with a melee attack, deal an extra 3 damage, and gain 1 [[Conditions & Effects#Exhaustion|exhaustion]].
+ **Stance: Protect the Weak -** Allies within the same melee as you gain +1 to reflex saves.
+ **Technique: Fall on the Sword -** When an ally would be struck in the same melee as you, instead you may take the blow.
+ **Technique: Rally the Righteous -** Allies within earshot may reduce their stress by d3.
+ **Technique: Feel No Pain -** When hurt, reduce the damage to 1 and gain 2 [[Conditions & Effects#Exhaustion|exhaustion]].
## Underhanded
+ **Stance: The Rat -** While balanced on the balls of your feet you may make reflex saves with +1 and exit melees unopposed.
+ **Technique: The Hawk -** You may make a free attack against a target who's head is below you, and deal two bonus damage; all without giving up your position.
+ **Technique: The Possum -** When struck, roll dice equal to your lost health. With 1SL you successfully fool those around you into thinking you've been knocked out or killed.
+ **Stance: The Snake -** With hands on hips you seem unthreatening. You may attack with any weapon on your belt, drawing it smoothly and striking in a single motion before initiative is rolled.
+ **Technique: The Dove -** At a moment's notice you can quickly straighten your clothes, sheathe your weapons, and appear as though a passerby, on brief inspection.

# Dead talents
Below are old talents that I found redundant with the styles system. While not are implemented yet, they remain as inspiration for the time being. 
### **Bodyguard

Max: 1

If someone attacks an ally within the same melee as you, with a successful move test, you can dive in to take the hit. This must be rolled before the dodge test is made.
### *Disarm

Max: Sleight-of-Hand

You are able to disarm an opponent with a careful flick of the wrist, or a well-aimed blow to the hand. For your action, you may attempt an opposed weapon skill test with a +1 bonus for each level in this talent. If you win, your opponent loses a held weapon. At 2 SL you knock it away, requiring the enemy to move to pick it up. At 5+ SL you are able to catch their weapon with a free hand, assuming you have one.

### *Dual Wielder

Max: 1

When armed with two weapons, you may attack with both for your Action. Attack with the weapon held in your primary hand as normal. Then, with a -2 to the test, attack with your second weapon against a valid target.


### *Feint

Max: Relevant melee skill

You have trained how to make false attacks in close combat to fool your opponent. You may make a Feint action on your turn, with an opposed (weapon skill) test versus their (weapon skill). If you win, and the opponent is attacked by you or an ally before their next turn, you may add the SL of your Feint to their roll.

### *Furious Assault

Max: 1

Your blows follow one another in quick succession, raining down on your opponents with righteous fury. Once per Round, if you hit an opponent in close combat, you may immediately spend your movement to make a second attack.

### *In-fighter

Max: Agility

Fighting outnumbered hand-to-hand does not scare you. Enemies get 1 less bonus for outnumbering you in melee per level in this talent.

### *Intercede

Max: 1

If you have not taken your turn this round, you may at any time interrupt another player or enemy and take your turn. 

This cannot interrupt an action such as after an attack connects but before damage is rolled.

### *Reversal

Max: Endurance

You are used to desperate combats, able to turn even the driest circumstances to your advantage. After being struck in melee, if on your next action you attack the target that struck you, deal bonus damage on hit equal to the damage they dealt you, up to your level in Reversal.

### *Riposte

Max: Sleight-of-Hand

Conforming to ‘the best defense is offense’, you respond to an incoming attack with a lightning-fast counterstrike of your own. If your weapon is both Light and Short you may deal automatic damage when attacked equal to the damage of the weapon. 

You can Riposte a number of attacks per combat equal to your Riposte level

### *Shieldsman

Max: Strength

You are skilled at using your shield to maneuver others in combat so you can take advantage of a desperate situation. When using a shield, if you succeed in an attack by 3SL or more, you can attempt to bash the target with your shield. Make an opposed grapple test with a +1 for each level in shieldsman. On a success deal 1 wound + test SL.

If taken 2 or more times, you may opt to shatter your shield on a blow to avoid its damage. This must be done before rolling armor.


### *Step Aside

Max: 1

You are skilled at being where enemy weapons are not. When you successfully dodge a melee attack you may freely disengage from the melee, requiring enemies to take a move action to re-engage you.

### *Strike to Stun

Max: 1

You know where to hit an opponent to knock the energy out of them. When attacking with a melee weapon you may opt to take -2 to the test and impart a difficulty to their future tests if you deal wounds. 

Successive stunning strikes build difficulty for the opponent, slowly whittling away their capabilities.
