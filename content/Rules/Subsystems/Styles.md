# Styles
The professional duelist, much like an academic, studies a particular school of combat. Each style has it's own origins, followings, and patterns.

These techniques are broken down in the following categories, each having a time and a place.
+ **Stances**: are the way you hold yourself in combat. They are your posture and movement. Stances provide passive advantages in combat and the duelist may enter a new stance at the end of each of their turns as a free action.
+ **Techniques**: are active moves in combat. While sometimes declared as part of an attack, many can be used at any time. One technique may be used per combat round.

Some styles have prerequisites as denoted in their individual sections.
## Universal
All duelists have access to a few common techniques, these are available no matter which schools you learn.
+ **Technique: Shield -** Hiding behind your shield, you let it take the blow. Double the number of gear dice from your shield.
+ **Technique: Parry -** You stand tall and attempt to move your opponent's weapon off-line. Roll 1d6, on a six the attack misses.
+ **Technique: Riposte -** When an opponent misses their strike, you may deal 2 damage in a counterattack.
## Orthodox
+ **Stance: Benedict's Third Form -** A broad, even stance that leaves options open to the duelist. When attacked, gain a +1 bonus to dodge saves.
+ **Technique: Frasier's 'Open Counterpoint' -** While in any of Benedict's Forms, (barring the seventh) you may react to an opponent's actions with an attack; using your combat action. This does not need to respect normal turn order.
+ **Stance: Benedict's Eighth Form -** A narrow, forward-leaning stance that encourages aggression. Gain +1 bonus to attacks.
+ **Technique: Rynault's  Assertion, (late) -** The revised version of one of Rynault's famous lunges. While your grandfather's instructor likely taught the technique, that makes it no less deadly today. When attacking with a pointed weapon, the opponent only benefits from half armor as your strike between the plates.
## Fashionable
+ **Technique: A Proper Introduction. -** You may direct the melee to a nearby target, bringing them into the melee whether they'd like to be in it or not.
+ **Technique: Call and Response -** You may use a technique another combatant has used since you last used a technique.
+ **Stance: Merchant's Daughter -** A misleading stance. Whenever an opponent misses a melee attack, they roll a d6, and on a 1, they fall prone.
+ **Stance: The Tumbler -** All unarmed attacks deal two damage instead of one.
+ **Stance: The Fool -** Whenever an attack misses, you may leave yourself open to a bonus attack. If that misses as well, you may use The Fool's Cut
+ **Technique: The Fool's Cut -** Can only be used with The Fool stance. Automatically hit a target, dealing twice your weapon's listed damage.

## Witchhunter
+ **Technique: Fear & Surprise -** If you win initiative on the first round of combat you can backstab your target for +4 to the attack bonus and double damage, providing you have enough movement to run up behind them.
+ **Stance: Ruthless Efficiency -** You deal +2 damage to anyone who dabbles with magic.
+ **Stance: Fanatical Devotion -** If you are charmed or otherwise mentally compelled the one who charmed you takes d3 damage every round the effect remains active.
+ **Stance: Scarlet Robed -** While garbed in official uniform you add your armor to saves vs. magics.
## Discrete
+ **Technique: Cloak & Dagger -** When an opponent misses their attack, you may smoothly wipe their blade clean of any poison on your cloak and stick them with your dagger for its damage value.
+ **Technique: Red-handed -** When attacking an opponent, you may attempt to strike their hand. If hit, they take 1 damage and drop their held weapon. 
+ **Stance: Off-Kilter -** Your posture is precarious, misleading. Opponents get -1 to the Dodge Saves when in melee with you.
+ **Stance: From the Shadows -** Shooting a bow from a hidden position does not give away your position.
+ **Technique: Bad Intentions -** When attacking, you may make a feint instead. For each SL on the attack, instead of damaging, gain twice that many bonus dice on the next attack made against the target, whether you or an ally makes the attack.
## Knightly
+ **Technique: Vanquish the Wicked -** When connecting with a melee attack, deal an extra 3 damage, and gain 1 [[Conditions & Effects#Exhaustion|exhaustion]].
+ **Stance: Protect the Weak -** Allies within the same melee as you gain +1 to Dodge saves.
+ **Stance: Slay the Monstrous -** Deal an extra +2 damage to large monsters
+ **Technique: Fall on the Sword -** When an ally would be struck in the same melee as you, instead you may take the blow.
+ **Technique: Rally the Righteous -** Allies within earshot may reduce their stress by d3.
+ **Technique: Feel No Pain -** When hurt, reduce the damage to 1 and gain 2 [[Conditions & Effects#Exhaustion|exhaustion]].
## Underhanded
+ **Stance: The Rat -** While balanced on the balls of your feet you may make dodge saves with +1 and exit melees unopposed.
+ **Technique: The Hawk -** You may make a free attack against a target who's head is below you, and deal two bonus damage; all without giving up your position.
+ **Technique: The Possum -** When struck, roll dice equal to your lost health. With 1SL you successfully fool those around you into thinking you've been knocked out or killed.
+ **Stance: The Snake -** With hands on hips you seem unthreatening. You may attack with any weapon on your belt, drawing it smoothly and striking in a single motion before initiative is rolled.
+ **Technique: The Dove -** At a moment's notice you can quickly straighten your clothes, sheathe your weapons, and appear as though a passerby, on brief inspection.
