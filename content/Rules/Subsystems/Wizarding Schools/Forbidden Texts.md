These are spells that are strictly illegal, and in most places possession of such spellbooks will result in a death sentence.
## Animate Dead
Target: 4--6

The dead are hateful, soulless things. To drag them from the ground is a sure way to burn at the stake. This spell does bind them to your will but when they find a way around your puppetry you will suffer.

A number of skeletons equal to the test’s SL rise from the ground. They will obey for a time, but cannot be trusted to remain loyal.
## Baleful Polymorph
Target: 3

A bolt of chaos is thrown at a target. Treat as a defense against a ranged attack, with the spell SL compared to the defense. If the attack succeeds, the victim is transformed, as desired by the caster.
## Charm Monster
Target: 1--3

SL creatures are bound to the will of the caster. Orders antithetical to their nature cause them to break free. 
## Charm Person
Target: 2

A single humanoid must make a Warding Save; if failed, they are bound to the will of the caster. Orders antithetical to their nature cause them to break free. Lasts 10SL minutes.
## Curse
Target: 1--2

A bane to all enemies that hear.

An enemy within line-of-sight gets a -1 to their actions. Lasts SL turns.
## Disintegrate
Target: 4--6

A spell of destruction, rare and evil. 

A single target and all they carry is destroyed on touch on a failed warding save.
## Hallucinatory Terrain
Target: 3SL

Creates an illusionary overlay which can hide, exaggerate or entirely change the underlying geography. At a distance, it is flawless. Dispelled with a warding save or if the target reaches the terrain.
## Magic Jar
Target: 200

The first step towards godhood. The first step towards lichdom. 

Magic Jar is a very polite way of phrasing the removal of one's soul from their body and puppeting it from the outside.. This allows the caster to switch bodies and even retain memories if executed well. The soul is still kept somewhere, first hypothesized as “in a jar”. Powerful entities are always on the watch for such activities, usually the spell is beneath gods proper, but lesser immortals will certainly interfere. 
## Phantasm
Target: 8--10

Another stain on the reputation of summoners at large. This spell is known as a spell for assassins, cowards, and the monstrous. Originally conceived as a way to achieve the upside of undead labor, without the risk of rebellion.

An illusionary creature is animated and given life; convincing enough to deal real damage. Those observing closely may make warding saves to disbelieve the phantasm - banishing it in doing so.
