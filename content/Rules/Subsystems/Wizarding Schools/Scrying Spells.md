## Clairvoyance
Target: 3SL

A hole forms in the casters forehead, allowing their presence to slip forth. 

The caster’s awareness is freed from the body, and able to travel up to half a mile from their body for SL hours. They may not pass through lead or 20’ of stone.
## Comprehend
Target: 1SL

The caster touches a willing creature, and their language skills are stolen by the caster for the duration. The caster can now understand and speak the languages of the target, even read and write if the target was literate.

Lasts SL days.
## Detect Magic
A drop of pure-white or pure-black dog blood in each eye.

All magic within eyesight reveals itself for SL minutes.
## Project Image
Target 5SL

An illusion of the self is projected forth and acts as double - albeit one under control. Physical attacks pass through it harmlessly - magical attacks are redirected to the caster. Lasts SL turns. 
## True Seeing
Target 2SL 

For 10 minutes, all illusions and magical visual alterations do not affect the caster. All hidden objects reveal themselves. The true nature of any magically changed item or creature is obvious.
