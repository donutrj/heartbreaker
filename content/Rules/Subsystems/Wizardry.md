Casting, not to be confused with witchcraft, is the classic wizardry. Long refined spells are passed from master to student, copied in colleges and libraries, and slowly iterated upon by generations.

As time passes, wars consume kingdoms, and fads pass; much of what is learned is lost to time. Branches form, and people start new schools of magic. 

Famous wizards retain credit for their spells, while the bold young add their own names to tomorrow's spells.
# Casting
Once a character has taken the wizardry talent, they use their channel and cast skills to recite their spells.






# Mana Drain
Every time a wizard casts a spell, they suffer one drain. This is a cumulative penalty to all future channeling and casting tests until the wizard spends a full night resting. 

This penalty builds with each cast, not channel, tests. Although once present, it affects both tests. 

Drain does not affect saves.

# Schools of Magic
Magic is divided into ‘schools’. This is not necessarily the result of base differences in magic but the product of different focuses of study resulting in different paths of understanding.
## Conjury
Conjury, also known as summoning, is a school of magic primarily used in agriculture. However no one pretends that it isn't used in all forms of circumstances. Weather and animals are two great areas of research.

## Elementalism
The goal of elementalism is to derive the most base elements of existence. Then use them to alter the world around them. This is the magic of fireballs and ice-rays. It is the study chosen by those who desire the power for the flashiest of spells and those who seek the deepest understanding of the universe’s building blocks.

## Enchantment
Once two separate schools, enchantment & transmutation. Enchantment is the art of granting properties to things that it would not otherwise have. This includes simple properties, ongoing effects, and altering of a thing’s base self.

## Scrying
Scrying is the art of knowing. Used to gain info from people, animals, the dead and others; it is a magic of communication. Primarily employed in politics and trade, it is largely frowned upon as a school of dark tricks. Regardless, it remains widely studied.
