# Tests
Tests should only be made when a character attempts to do something challenging. If a professional, under no pressure, with the right tools attempts a task; they do the task. If someone skilled in sleight-of-hand attempts to pick a lock using lockpicks. They do, no test is required. Now if they’re trying to pick a lock before the guards round a corner, or maybe they have all the time in the world but they’re using a dagger instead of lockpicks, then a test is required. 
## How to make a Test
All tests are made by identifying which attribute best fits the challenge. Then consider the following factors to augment the number of d6s rolled. Each success is considered one success level, or SL for short.
1. Does the character's background or any skills fit the current test? Add a bonus die for the background and bonus dice equal to the level in a relevant skill.
2. Does the character currently have any stress? Add stress dice to the pool equal to their stress.
3. Is the character using any equipment / weapon? Add equipment dice equal to the bonus it'd provide
4. Does the character have some sort of advantage? The GM will let you know if something would provide extra bonus dice.
### Pushing a Test
After a test is made, a player can elect to push a roll. This is attempted to achieve greater SL at the risk of character harm. To push a roll do the following:
1. Set all ones and sixes aside
2. Increase stress by one
3. Roll the remaining dice (adding the new stress die)
4. Add all new sixes to the test's SL
5. Note all ones and the dice's origins

Depending on the origin of ones, different things occur:
+ Ones rolled on attribute dice reduce the attribute, hindering further tests until recovery
+ Ones rolled on stress dice trigger an immediate panic save
+ Ones rolled on gear dice damage the gear or break it completely when reduced to 0
+ Ones rolled on skill and bonus dice have no ill effects
# Saves
Saves are made whenever something is happening to a character. Where a test is used when a character jumps from a ledge, a save is made to avoid falling rocks. The GM will indicate when saves are required. 
## How to make a Save
Making a save is largely the same as making a test, but there are a few exceptions. Namely, saves do not benefit from stress. Each save has different consequences when a pushed save is unsuccessful.
### Pushing Saves
+ Panic: roll 3d6 on the panic table and keep the two highest
+ Reflex: fall prone, risking damaging equipment
+ Warding: Become scattered
+ Withstand: Take 1d6 damage & reduce armor on ones (gear dice)
# Panic
Whenever you elect to push a test, or in the case of some abilities, you will gain stress. Stress can be helpful, each stress grants you an extra die on tests. Downside is when you roll a one on a stress die (even when not pushing) you must make a Panic Save.

If you succeed, reduce stress to 0 and continue the action. If you fail, roll on the following table to determine the effect:

| 2d6+stress | Panic Effect                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3          | A momentary stutter. No further effect                                                                                                                        |
| 4–5        | Deep trembles. You get -1 SL to your next roll.                                                                                                               |
| 6–7        | Your limbs go numb. You are Weakened for 1 minute. Increase Stress by 1.                                                                                      |
| 8          | You can barely breathe. Increase Stress by 2.                                                                                                                 |
| 9–10       | Scream! All allies within earshot increase stress by 1.                                                                                                       |
| 11         | Freeze. You are Stunned for d3 minutes. Allies within line of sight gain 1 stress.                                                                            |
| 12         | Drop held item or clutch it tight and increase stress by 2                                                                                                    |
| 13         | Run for cover. Your next turn must be taken running for the nearest safe place. Remove all stress if you make it.                                             |
| 14–15      | Berserk. You immediately roll to attack the nearest thing. Select randomly. Remove all stress if you connect. This attack does not benefit from stress dice.0 |
| 16+        | Heart attack. Reduce Wounds to 0. Transfer all stress to allies<br><br>within line of sight.                                                                  |
## Reducing Stress
In the heat of combat, a character can make a Intelligence Test to think it through and reduce their stress. Alternatively an ally may attempt a Personality test for the same effect. On a success, reduce stress to zero.

Once calmness has returned, return all stress to zero. If the party is in a stressful situation, the GM may raise the minimum stress.
# Dark Bargains
At times the GM may offer a dark bargain in exchange for many things. Usually this will be offered to auto-succeed a test or find some key parts for a repair. If the offered player agrees to the dark bargain, the GM will add a dark bargain to the pool. 

The GM will spend these dark bargains to inflict minor miseries upon the players. Note that these effects are not limited to the players that accepted the dark bargain initially. Typical examples might include:

- A friend of the party betrays the group
- A substantial loss of money
- Bad actors make substantial progress in their goals
- A failed roll goes from bad to worse
- An enemy’s attack hits true
# Inventory
A character’s inventory is split between three spaces: hands, belt, and pack. Each space uses slots to roughly denote the amount they can hold. One slot can hold roughly a dozen eggs, but is more an idea than a hard rule.

| Items   | Size                                                                                                                              |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ammo    | Ammo can be stored in bundles of six                                                                                              |
| Armor   | A number of slots equal to it's impeding, while not less than one                                                                 |
| Books   | Books take up a slot each                                                                                                         |
| Clothes | A day's clothes equals one slot, more elaborate attire will require more space                                                    |
| Coinage | Coins can be grouped into sacks of 100 per slot. Loose change and other coin sized objects can be grouped together into one slot. |
| Potions | One slot                                                                                                                          |
| Shields | Cannot be stored on belt, one slot                                                                                                |
| Weapons | Two-handed weapons take up two slots, otherwise one slot                                                                          |
## Hands
Hands are what characters actively hold. There are two slots, each for one hand. If weapons are held here, they are considered drawn, and people will be hostile.
## Belt
A character’s belt is where you’d stash your weapon, ammo, and other rapidly accessible items.
## Pack
A character’s pack is where they keep bulk items that don’t need to be accessed in the heat of the moment. A pack is no less than two slots, and is otherwise equal to a character’s current [[Characters#Attributes|strength]]. Despite being large shields only take one slot because it is assumed you’d strap them to the back like a turtle shell. Make sure to remove controversial insignia before heading into town.
