# Tests
Tests should only be made when a character attempts to do something challenging. If a professional, under no pressure, with the right tools attempts a task; they do the task. If someone skilled in sleight-of-hand attempts to pick a lock using lockpicks. They do, no test is required. Now if they’re trying to pick a lock before the guards round a corner, or maybe they have all the time in the world but they’re using a dagger instead of lockpicks, then a test is required. 
## How to make a Test
All tests are made by identifying which attribute best fits the challenge. Then consider the following factors to augment the number of d6s rolled. Each success is considered one success level, or SL for short.
1. Does the character's background or any skills fit the current test? Add a bonus die for the background and bonus dice equal to the level in a relevant skill.
2. Does the character currently have any stress? Add stress dice to the pool equal to their stress.
3. Is the character using any equipment / weapon? Add equipment dice equal to the bonus it'd provide
4. Does the character have some sort of advantage? The GM will let you know if something would provide extra bonus dice.
### Pushing a Test
After a test is made, a player can elect to push a roll. This is attempted to achieve greater SL at the risk of character harm. To push a roll do the following:
1. Set all ones and sixes aside
2. Increase stress by one
3. Roll the remaining dice (adding the new stress die)
4. Add all new sixes to the test's SL
5. Note all ones and the dice's origins

Depending on the origin of ones, different things occur:
+ Ones rolled on attribute dice reduce the attribute, hindering further tests until recovery
+ Ones rolled on stress dice trigger an immediate panic save
+ Ones rolled on gear dice damage the gear or break it completely when reduced to 0
+ Ones rolled on skill and bonus dice have no ill effects
# Saves
Saves are made whenever something is happening to a character. Where a test is used when a character jumps from a ledge, a save is made to avoid falling rocks. The GM will indicate when saves are required. 
## How to make a Save
Making a save is largely the same as making a test, but there are a few exceptions. Namely, saves do not benefit from stress. Each save has different consequences when a pushed save is unsuccessful.
### Pushing Saves
+ Panic: roll 3d6 on the panic table and keep the two highest
+ Reflex: fall prone, risking damaging equipment
+ Warding: Become scattered
+ Withstand: Take 1d6 damage & reduce armor on ones (gear dice)
