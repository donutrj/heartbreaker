# Blinded
A blinded character cannot see. When attempting an action, they must first commit then there's a 50% chance they can roll as normal. Otherwise the action fails.
# Blindsight
Blindsight ignores the [[Effects and Conditions#Blinded|blinded]] condition within it's radius, such as when in a dark cave.
# Damaged
A damaged weapon is visibly battered. It has no mechanical effect, but if a damaged weapon becomes damaged a second time before it is repaired it is instead destroyed. 
# Exhausted Attribute
All tests with the exhausted attribute suffer one level of disadvantage.
# Flanked
A character has enemies in opposite hexes either side of them. See [[Mechanics#Combat#Flanking|Flanking]].
# Invisibility
Targeting an invisible target is the same as taking an action while [[Effects and Conditions#Blinded|Blind]].
# Overrun
A character has enemies in any four adjacent hexes. See [[Mechanics#Combat#Overrun|Overrun]].
# Prone
A prone character has disadvantage on Weapon Skill and Dexterity-based tests. It takes their movement in combat to stand up from prone.
# Slowed
A slowed character can only move or take an action on their turn.
