# Weapons
The standard weapon is a melee two-handed thing that does 1d6 damage. Anyone can use a standard weapon.
## Qualities
To represent different weapons, they can be modified with a variety of qualities. No weapon can do more than d12 damage, barring wizardry.

If the damage die is easily divisible into smaller dice, you may opt to use the (sum? product? division result?) e.g. 1d8 -> 2d4, 1d12 --> 2d6 or 3d4. 

+ **Martial:** Increment damage die by 1. Requires class proficiency
+ **Long:** Increment damage die by 1, cannot be used indoors
+ **Short:** Reduce damage die by 1, useable in one hand & concealable. If Ranged, reduce range by half.
+ **Light:** Reduce damage die by 1, can use Dexterity or Strength as attack bonus.
+ **Reach:** Treats hexes two away as adjacent, cannot attack or defend opponents next to you. Attack with disadvantage. Weapon must also be Long.
+ **Ranged:** The weapon can shoot up to 40' (60' if Martial). Do not add attribute bonus to damage rolls. Use Dexterity instead of Strength as attack modifier.
+ **Complex:** Increase damage die by 1. Weapon is substantially more expensive and rare.
+ **Cumbersome:** Increase damage die by 1. Attack with disadvantage.

*Use common sense with these, obviously something cannot be both long and short. I'm sure there's other contradictions as well.*

# Armor
Armor is there to provide you protection, but there's a reason beyond cost why it isn't worn day-to-day. Regardless of armor type, wearing **armor applies disadvantage to Coordination and Subterfuge Tests**. Heavier armors convey greater penalties.

There are three different classes of armor, Light, Medium, and Heavy.
+ **Light armor** reduces incoming damage by 1d4.
+ **Medium armor** reduces incoming damage by 1d6 and imposes disadvantage on Reflex Saves.
+ **Heavy armor** reduces incoming damage by 1d8. It imposes disadvantage on Physique and Reflex Saves.

If using a shield, increase the armor die size by one.
