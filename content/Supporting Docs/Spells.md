#wizard
# Blink
#unused 
+ Range: 40'
+ Target: Point in space
+ Duration: Instant

The caster momentarly transforms into a coporial phantasmal bolt (about the size of a small orange), shooting to a point within line of sight and unblocked by physical barrier. Upon stopping, they immediately reform to their usual self with a moderately loud *THWOP*.
# Carrion Compass 
+ Range: touch
+ Target: corpse or undead creature of (count)HD or fewer 
+ Duration (sum) miles or fewer

Caster touches a part of the target, traditionally an organ or bone, and it begins to levitate. If the target was a corpse, their piece begins to slowly levitate towards the person they would most blame for their death (if murdered, this is typically their killer). If the target is an undead, their piece begins to slowly levitate towards its controller; if they had no controller, the piece levitates towards their resurrector; if raised as undead by some curséd tomb or battlefield or artifact instead of a necromancer, the piece levitates towards some curséd tomb or battlefield or artifact; if none of these things are the case, or if they were the case but the controller/resurrector/curséd tomb has been slain or destroyed, the piece burns to ash.
# Chain Lightning
#unused
+ Range: 20'
+ Target: Creature
+ Duration: Instant

Caster points at target within line of sight, making a ranged attack against the defender's Warding Save. On a sucess, the bolt jumps to a random target within Range, forcing a Warding Save, originating from first target. 

This repeats a total of 1 + (count) times or until a target makes the warding save.

All struck, take 1d10 + (sum) damage, rolled seperately. The caster cannot be targeted, nor can a target be struck twice.
# Color Spray
+ Range: 15' cone
+ Target: Sighted Creatures
+ Duration: Varies

If (sum) is equal to or greater to the creature's HD, it is befuddled for 1d6 rounds.

If (sum) is three times the creature's HD or more, it is stunned for a round, then befuddled for 1d6 rounds.

If (sum) is five times the creature's HD, it is stunned for 1d6 rounds, then befuddled for 1d6 rounds.
# Death Mask
+ Range: Touch
+ Target: Humanoid Corpse
+ Duration: Permanent

You touch a corpse and the face peels off like a mask, while the rest of the corpse quickly rots to dust. When you (and only you) wear the mask, you will look and sound like the person whose face you're wearing, but only to sentient people (no effect on animals, spirits, or constructs). The mask will rot into uselessness after (sum) days. If (count) is at least 4, the mask is permanent.

Casting this spell consumes the corpse.
# Death Scythe
+ Range: Touch
+ Target: Corpse
+ Duration: (count) * 30min

The corpse disintegrates as you pluck a black scythe from its center of mass. This scythe is a scythe +1 (a Heavy weapon) that deals double damage to creatures of the same type. (For example, a scythe made from a troll corpse would deal double damage to trolls.) This spell consumes the corpse.
# Disguise
+ Range: Touch
+ Target: Object
+ Duration: (count) hours

You cloak the object in illusion, making it appear as another object of the same type. An apple could be disguised as any other type of fruit; a table could be disguised as any other type of furniture. A humanoid can be disguised as any other humanoid of comparable size. This only extends to the visual properties of the object (not voice, smell, etc).
# Doom Song
+ Range: 50'
+ Target: Creature
+ Duration: Concentration

Target creature takes (sum) damage. On each subsequent turn, the damage increases by +1d6 and repeats (this stacks).
# Essential Salts
+ Range: Touch
+ Target: Corpse
+ Duration: n/a

You reduce a corpse into a coarse grit that can be stored in a tiny pouch or vial (three per inventory slot). You can speak with the spirit as many times as you want. Over several conversations, the spirit will slowly regain it's memory, personality, and goals.

Casting this spell consumes the corpse.

# Explode Corpse
+ Range: 50'
+ Target: Corpse
+ Duration: n/a

Target corpse explodes, dealing (sum) * 2 damage in a 20' diameter, up to a maximum dependent on the size of the corpse. This spell affects undead.
+ Dog: 1d6
+ Human: 2d6
+ Cow: 4d6
+ Elephant: 6d6
+ Whale: 8d6

Reflex Save for half damage. Normal corpses and undead you control automatically fail their save. 

Casting this spell consumes the corpse.
# False Life
+ Range: Touch
+ Target: Creature
+ Duration: n/a

Creature is healed for (sum) * 2 HP, up to (sum) points higher than their normal maximum HP. Creature's healed in this way gain the Curse of False Life, and cannot regain HP by any means for (count) days.
# Fear
+ Range: 50'
+ Target: Creature
+ Duration: (sum) minutes

Target creature is afraid of you for duration, requiring a Willpower Save to act against you. The caster can target multiple creatures, dividing dice between them before rolling.
# Hypnotic Orb
+ Range: Touch
+ Target: Object
+ Duration: 10 minutes

You enchant a mostly-spherical object so that it's surface is covered with a captivating, shimmering pattern. (Apples and most potatoes count as mostly-spherical; coins do not). Any creature who sees the enchanted object must make a save or be compelled to sit still and observe it for the spell's duration. Flying creatures will land, or circle it. You are not immune to this effect.

The effect is broken if the line of sight is broken, if something startles them (a loud adjacent shout), or if they see signs of obvious danger (such as someone killing their friends).

Groups of statistically identical NPCs should make their saves as a group.
# Illusion
+ Range: 50'
+ Target: (count) * 5' diameter
+ Duration: Concentration

You create an illusion (basically a perfect hologram) of whatever object or creature you want. It can move as long however you dictate, but it cannot make any sound (or smell, touch, etc). Remember that illusions can only add, not subtract. (They can cover up a hole, but not create the illusion of a hole).
# Invisibility
+ Range: Touch
+ Target: Object
+ Duration: (count) * 10 minutes

Object is invisible as long as it doesn't move. Each round of movement reduces the duration by 10 minutes. Invisible creatures gain the ability to see other invisible objects. Alternatively, can be used to suppress an object's invisibility.
# Light
+ Range: 50'
+ Target: Object
+ Duration: Permanent

You create a source of bright light within line of sight stuck to the target object. The light is about the size of a grapefruit. It can shine brightly up to 30'. Dim light is cast another 10'.

Note that the wizard does not get Magic Dice back unless the spell is dismissed at the caster's whim.
# Mirror Image
+ Range: Self
+ Target: Self
+ Duration: 10 minutes

You create 1d4 + (count) illusory images of yourself, which move as you move and always stay within 5' of you. They are constantly stepping through each other, so that it is impossible to tell which is which. When an enemy attacks you, roll to see if they hit you or an image. An image vanishes as soon as it suffers a solid impact (a blow from a mace, but also a slap). Area effects such as a dragon's breath will cause all images to instantly vanish (and you'll take fire breath damage, naturally).
# Mirror Object
+ Range: Touch
+ Target: Mirror
+ Duration: (count) hours

You reach into a mirror-like surface and pull out a copy of an object adjacent to the mirror. The object that you pull out must be within reach of the mirror (as if it were a window), small enough to fit through the mirror (as if it were a window) and light enough for you to pull through with one hand.

The mirror object looks and feels exactly like the object it copied. It doesn't copy any magical properties of the object. You cannot duplicate living things in this way. The mirror object pops like a bubble if it suffers a solid blow (a mirror sword could be used once before it vanishes).

If you invest at least 4 dice into this spell, it can copy the magical properties of an item, but those magical properties will only function once. For items with continuous properties, such as a flying carpet, the magic properties will last no longer than 10 minutes (DM's choice).
# Prismatic Ray
+ Range: 200'
+ Target: Object
+ Duration: n/a

Target suffers a different effect depending on which color strikes the target. Roll a d10.
1. Red. Target takes (sum) fire damage, save for half.

3. Yellow. Target takes (sum) lightning damage, save for half.
4. Green. Target takes (sum) acid damage, save for half.
5. Blue. Target takes (sum) ice damage, save for half.

10. Struck thrice. Roll a d6 three times.
# Raise Crawling Claw
+ Range: Touch
+ Target: Corpse
+ Duration: 10 Minutes

Touch a severed hand from a corpse, animating it. It obeys spoken instruction, assuming the ears of the corpse can hear you. It has the strength and dexterity of the former owner at time of death.

Additionally, you know how to carve an eye rune into the crawling claw (a one hour process). If you do, you can close your eyes and hold the claw's opposite hand and see through the rune-eye. 
# Raise Skeleton
+ Range: Touch
+ Target: Corpse
+ Duration: Permanent

Nimble but strong, but fragile. In the condition as time of death. 

Skeletons will follow simple instructions.

Magic Dice are not refreshed until skeleton is dispelled at wizard's whim.
# Raise Skin Kite
+ Range: Touch
+ Target: Flayed Corpse
+ Duration: Permanent

Once a corpse is flayed, it takes an hour to make it into a suitable kite. The kite can have the rune of the mouth carved into it, and if so the caster can cast from the kite, rather than treating themselves as the origin. 

A skin kite can fly clumsily, relying on winds to keep it aloft.

Magic Dice are not refreshed until zombie is dispelled at wizard's whim.
# Raise Zombie
+ Range: Touch
+ Target: Corpse
+ Duration: Permanent

Slow and lumbering, but strong as base creature. In the condition as time of death. When reduced to zero HP, 50% chance of returning to 1 HP at start of next turn.

Zombies will follow simple instructions.

Magic Dice are not refreshed until the skin kite is dispelled at wizard's whim.
# Rot
+ Range: Touch
+ Target: Object
+ Duration: n/a

Creatures take (count) * 2 damage, warding save for half, and show physical (but not mechanical) signs of aging (white hair, wrinkles, but no loss of strength). Objects are aged according to how many dice are invested.

Books sprout into mold, wood becomes soggy, lamps run out of fuel and grow cold, and stone is entirely unaffected.

+ 1 die: (sum) days
+ 2 dice: (sum) months
+ 3+ dice: (sum) years

Undead are not damaged, and are instead healed for (sum) + (count) HP.
# Scry
+ Range: (count)
+ Target: Point in space
+ Duration: Concentration

You conjure an invisible sensor to a point in space that you designate. Unlike most spells, you do not have to have line of sight to cast it. If you can see invisible things, the sensor is a duplicate of your eye. As long as you maintain concentration, you can see through this sensor with your normal senses. This spell requires something to scry on, usually a mirror, quiet pool, clouds, or bonfire.

If you invest at least two casting dice, you can also hear through the sensor. If you invest at least three dice, you can also speak through the sensor.

If you use an actual crystal ball when casting this spell, the range is instead (count) miles. Crystal balls are rare enough that they are never offered for sale, but are worth upwards of 3,000s
# Wall of Light
+ Range: 50'
+ Target: Wall or Sphere
+ Duration: 10 minutes

You conjure either (a) a hemisphere that is 5' in diameter for every invested casting die, or (b) a 10' by 10' panel for every invested casting die, which can be arranged in any contiguous formation joined by their edges. For example, three casting dice would allow you to build a 10' by 30' wall.

The wall is intangible, but you can control what each side shows. It can be either (a) inky darkness, (b) light out to 30', (c) mirror, or (d) transparency. Both sides do not have to show the same thing, so one side could show a mirror surface while the other can be seen through. You can change these surfaces with a thought.
# Wizard Vision
+ Range: Touch
+ Target: Sighted Creature
+ Duration: 10 minutes

If you invest one die: You can see invisible things. You can see through illusions. Non-magical disguises (such as the ones assassins use) are not penetrated. 

If you invest two dice: This can only be cast on yourself. As above, except you can see through magical darkness, and see the true forms of shapeshifters. There are also some permanent effects:

+ You can forever see invisible things as a slight warping or lensing of light. You know “there's something over there” and what size it roughly is, but nothing else.
+ You can tell if someone else is a spellcaster by looking them in the eyes.

The price for this gift is your mind. It is difficult for the human brain to stare at all the etheropelagic lifeforms that surround us, and all the unseen angles of parallel universes. You suffer a permanent loss of 1d6 Wisdom (as you reject the impossible reality you are looking at, and go a tiny bit insane) or 1d6 Charisma (as you accept this transcendental truth and become forever alienated from your fellow humans, who will never understand the truth).

(Werewolves are both wolf and human, and appear as a wolf through your left eye and a human through your right eye. Dopplegangers have no true form and appear as a roiling mass of all the people they've been before.)
