The professional fighter, much like an accidemic, studies a particular school of combat. Each style has it's own origins, followings, ups and downs.

These techniques are broken down in the following catagories, each having a time and a place.
+ **Stances**: are the way you hold yourself in combat. They are your posture and movement. Stances provide passive advantages in combat and the fighter may enter a new stance at the end of each of their turns as a free action
+ **Techniques**: are active moves in combat. While not always an action you can make on your turn, they can be and are often bonuses under specific sercumstances.

Some styles have prerequisets as denoted in their individual sections.
