After putting a lot of work into Verdigris, I wanted to create a class based system, and what better to riff on than 5e? There were some talents that just felt like they would make too much sense in a class system.

When I discovered glog classes on the blogosphere, I thought I had to give it my own go. You'll see a lot of their words scattered throughout in this collage of a game. 

As it stands right now I've got the 5e classes that I care about in roughly working states, and a semi-functional battle system with it's roots in Troika!.
